## Matthew Chapter 1

**1** The book of the genealogy of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham.

**2** Abraham fathered Isaac, Isaac fathered Jacob, and Jacob fathered Judah and his brothers, **3** and Judah fathered Perez and Zerah by Tamar, and Perez fathered Hezron, and Hezron fathered Ram, **4** and Ram fathered Amminadab, and Amminadab fathered Nahshon, and Nahshon fathered Salmon, **5** and Salmon fathered Boaz by Rahab, and Boaz fathered Obed by Ruth, and Obed fathered Jesse, **6** and Jesse fathered David the king.

And David fathered Solomon by the wife of Uriah, **7** and Solomon fathered Rehoboam, and Rehoboam fathered Abijah, and Abijah fathered Asaph, **8** and Asaph fathered Jehoshaphat, and Jehoshaphat fathered Joram, and Joram fathered Uzziah, **9** and Uzziah fathered Jotham, and Jotham fathered Ahaz, and Ahaz fathered Hezekiah, **10** and Hezekiah fathered Manasseh, and Manasseh fathered Amos, and Amos fathered Josiah, **11** and Josiah fathered Jechoniah and his brothers at the time of the deportation to Babylon.

**12** And after the deportation to Babylon: Jechoniah fathered Shealtiel, and Shealtiel fathered Zerubbabel, **13** and Zerubbabel fathered Abiud, and Abiud fathered Eliakim, and Eliakim fathered Azor, **14** and Azor fathered Zadok, and Zadok fathered Achim, and Achim fathered Eliud, **15** and Eliud fathered Eleazar, and Eleazar fathered Matthan, and Matthan fathered Jacob, **16** and Jacob fathered Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom Jesus was born, who is called Christ.

**17** So all the generations from Abraham to David were fourteen generations, and from David to the deportation to Babylon fourteen generations, and from the deportation to Babylon to the Christ fourteen generations.

**18** Now the birth of Jesus Christ took place in this way. When his mother Mary had been betrothed to Joseph, before they came together she was found to be with child from the Holy Spirit. **19** And her husband Joseph, being a just man and unwilling to put her to shame, resolved to divorce her quietly.

**20** But as he considered these things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, "Joseph, son of David, do not fear to take Mary as your wife, for that which is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit. **21** She will bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins."

**22** All this took place to fulfill what the Lord had spoken by the prophet:
**23** "Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son,
and they shall call his name Immanuel"
(which means, God with us).

**24** When Joseph woke from sleep, he did as the angel of the Lord commanded him; he took his wife, **25** but knew her not until she had given birth to a son. And he called his name Jesus.
