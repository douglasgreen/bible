# Deuterocanon

## Tobit

Tobit is recognized as Deuterocanonical Scripture by the Roman Catholic, Greek Orthodox, and Russian Orthodox Churches.

### Chapter 1

The book of the words of Tobit, the son of Tobiel, the son of Ananiel, the son of Aduel, the son of Gabael, of the seed of Asiel, of the tribe of Naphtali; who in the days of Enemessar king of the Assyrians was carried away captive out of Thisbe, which is on the right hand of Kedesh Naphtali in Galilee above Asher.

I, Tobit walked in the ways of truth and righteousness all the days of my life, and I did many alms deeds to my kindred and my nation, who went with me into the land of the Assyrians, to Nineveh. When I was in my own country, in the land of Israel, while I was yet young, all the tribe of Naphtali my father fell away from the house of Jerusalem, which was chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, that all the tribes should sacrifice there, and the temple of the habitation of the Most High was hallowed and built therein for all ages. All the tribes which fell away together sacrificed to the heifer Baal, and so did the house of Naphtali my father. I alone went often to Jerusalem at the feasts, as it has been ordained to all Israel by an everlasting decree, having the first fruits and the tenths of my increase, and that which was first shorn; and I gave them at the altar to the priests the sons of Aaron. I gave a tenth part of all my increase to the sons of Levi, who ministered at Jerusalem. A second tenth part I sold away, and went, and spent it each year at Jerusalem. A third tenth I gave to them to whom it was appropriate, as Deborah my father’s mother had commanded me, because I was left an orphan by my father. When I became a man, I took as wife Anna of the seed of our own family. With her, I became the father of Tobias. When I was carried away captive to Nineveh, all my kindred and my relatives ate of the bread of the Gentiles; but I kept myself from eating, because I remembered God with all my soul. So the Most High gave me grace and favor in the sight of Enemessar, and I was his purchasing agent. And I went into Media, and left ten talents of silver in trust with Gabael, the brother of Gabrias, at Rages of Media.

And when Enemessar was dead, Sennacherib his son reigned in his place. In his time, the highways were troubled, and I could no longer go into Media. In the days of Enemessar, I did many alms deeds to my kindred: I gave my bread to the hungry, and my garments to the naked. If I saw any of my race dead, and thrown out on the wall of Ninevah, I buried him. If Sennacherib the king killed any, when he came fleeing from Judea, I buried them privately; for in his wrath he killed many; and the bodies were sought for by the king, and were not found. But one of the Ninevites went and showed to the king concerning me, how I buried them, and hid myself; and when I knew that I was sought for to be put to death, I withdrew myself for fear. And all my goods were forcibly taken away, and there was nothing left to me, save my wife Anna and my son Tobias. No more than fifty five days passed before two of his sons killed him, and they fled into the mountains of Ararat. And Sarchedonus his son reigned in his place; and he appointed Achiacharus my brother Anael’s son over all the accounts of his kingdom, and over all his affairs. Achiacharus requested me, and I came to Nineveh. Now Achiacharus was cupbearer, keeper of the signet, steward, and overseer of the accounts. Sarchedonus appointed him next to himself, but he was my brother’s son.

### Chapter 2

Now when I had come home again, and my wife Anna was restored to me, and my son Tobias, in the feast of Pentecost, which is the holy feast of the seven weeks, there was a good dinner prepared for me, and I sat down to eat. I saw abundance of meat, and I said to my son, “Go and bring whatever poor man you find of our kindred, who is mindful of the Lord. Behold, I wait for you.”

Then he came, and said, “Father, one of our race is strangled, and has been cast out in the marketplace.” Before I had tasted anything, I sprang up, and took him up into a chamber until the sun had set. Then I returned, washed myself, ate my bread in heaviness, and remembered the prophecy of Amos, as he said,

“Your feasts will be turned into mourning,

and all your mirth into lamentation.

So I wept: and when the sun had set, I went and dug a grave, and buried him. My neighbors mocked me, and said, “He is no longer afraid to be put to death for this matter; and yet he fled away. Behold, he buries the dead again.” The same night I returned from burying him, and slept by the wall of my courtyard, being polluted; and my face was uncovered. I didn’t know that there were sparrows in the wall. My eyes were open and the sparrows dropped warm dung into my eyes, and white films came over my eyes. I went to the physicians, and they didn’t help me; but Achiacharus nourished me, until I went into Elymais.

My wife Anna wove cloth in the women’s chambers, and sent the work back to the owners. They on their part paid her wages, and also gave her a kid. But when it came to my house, it began to cry, and I said to her, “Where did this kid come from? Is it stolen? Give it back to the owners; for it is not lawful to eat anything that is stolen.” But she said, “It has been given to me for a gift more than the wages.”

I didn’t believe her, and I asked her to return it to the owners; and I was ashamed of her.

But she answered and said to me, “Where are your alms and your righteous deeds? Behold, you and all your works are known.”

### Chapter 3

I was grieved and wept, and prayed in sorrow, saying,

“O Lord, you are righteous, and all your works and all your ways are mercy and truth, and you judge true and righteous judgment forever. Remember me, and look at me. Don’t take vengeance on me for my sins and my ignorances, and the sins of my fathers who sinned before you. For they disobeyed your commandments. You gave us as plunder, for captivity, for death, and for a proverb of reproach to all the nations among whom we are dispersed. Now your judgments are many and true, that you should deal with me according to my sins and the sins of my fathers, because we didn’t keep your commandments, for we didn’t walk in truth before you. Now deal with me according to that which is pleasing in your sight. Command my spirit to be taken from me, that I may be released, and become earth. For it is more profitable for me to die rather than to live, because I have heard false reproaches, and there is much sorrow in me. Command that I be released from my distress, now, and go to the everlasting place. Don’t turn your face away from me.”

The same day it happened to Sarah the daughter of Raguel in Ecbatana of Media, that she also was reproached by her father’s maidservants; because that she had been given to seven husbands, and Asmodaeus the evil spirit killed them, before they had lain with her. And they said to her, “Do you not know that you strangle your husbands? You have had already seven husbands, and you haven’t borne the name of any one of them. Why do you scourge us? If they are dead, go your ways with them. Let us never see either son or daughter from you.” When she heard these things, she was grieved exceedingly, so that she thought about hanging herself. Then she said, “I am the only daughter of my father. If I do this, it will be a reproach to him, and I will bring down his old age with sorrow to the grave.” Then she prayed by the window, and said, “Blessed are you, O Lord my God, and blessed is your holy and honorable name forever! Let all your works praise you forever! And now, Lord, I have set my eyes and my face toward you. Command that I be released from the earth, and that I no longer hear reproach. You know, Lord, that I am pure from all sin with man, and that I never polluted my name or the name of my father in the land of my captivity. I am the only daughter of my father, and he has no child that will be his heir, nor brother near him, nor son belonging to him, that I should keep myself for a wife to him. Seven husbands of mine are dead already. Why should I live? If it doesn’t please you to kill me, command some regard to be had of me, and pity taken of me, and that I hear no more reproach.”

The prayer of both was heard before the glory of the great God. Raphael also was sent to heal them both, to scale away the white films from Tobit’s eyes, and to give Sarah the daughter of Raguel for a wife to Tobias the son of Tobit; and to bind Asmodaeus the evil spirit; because it belonged to Tobias that he should inherit her. At that very time, Tobit returned and entered into his house, and Sarah the daughter of Raguel came down from her upper chamber.

### Chapter 4

In that day Tobit remembered the money which he had left in trust with Gabael in Rages of Media, and he said to himself, I have asked for death; why do I not call my son Tobias, that I may explain to him about the money before I die? And he called him, and said,

“My child, if I die, bury me. Don’t despise your mother. Honor her all the days of your life, and do that which is pleasing to her, and don’t grieve her. Remember, my child, that she has seen many dangers for you, when you were in her womb. When she is dead, bury her by me in one grave. My child, be mindful of the Lord our God all your days, and don’t let your will be set to sin and to transgress his commandments: do righteousness all the days of your life, and don’t follow the ways of unrighteousness. For if you do what is true, your deeds will prosperously succeed for you, and for all those who do righteousness. Give alms from your possessions. When you give alms, don’t let your eye be envious. Don’t turn away your face from any poor man, and the face of God won’t be turned away from you. As your possessions are, give alms of it according to your abundance. If you have little, don’t be afraid to give alms according to that little; for you lay up a good treasure for yourself against the day of necessity; because alms-giving delivers from death, and doesn’t allow you to come into darkness. Alms is a good gift in the sight of the Most High for all that give it. Beware, my child, of all fornication, and take first a wife of the seed of your fathers. Don’t take a strange wife, who is not of your father’s tribe; for we are the descendants of the prophets. Remember, my child, that Noah, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, our fathers of old time, all took wives of their kindred, and were blessed in their children, and their seed will inherit the land. And now, my child, love your kindred, and don’t scorn your kindred and the sons and the daughters of your people in your heart, to take a wife of them; for in scornfulness is destruction and much trouble, and in idleness is decay and great lack; for idleness is the mother of famine. Don’t let the wages of any man who works for you wait with you, but give it to him out of hand. If you serve God, you will be rewarded. Take heed to yourself, my child, in all your works, and be discreet in all your behavior. And what you yourself hate, do to no man. Don’t drink wine to drunkenness, and don’t let drunkenness go with you on your way. Give of your bread to the hungry, and of your garments to those who are naked. Give alms from all your abundance. Don’t let your eye be envious when you give alms. Pour out your bread on the burial of the just, and give nothing to sinners. Ask counsel of every man who is wise, and don’t despise any counsel that is profitable. Bless the Lord your God at all times, and ask of him that your ways may be made straight, and that all your paths and counsels may prosper; for every nation has no counsel; but the Lord himself gives all good things, and he humbles whom he will, as he will. And now, my child, remember my commandments, and let them not be blotted out of your mind. And now I explain to you about the ten talents of silver, which I left in trust with Gabael the son of Gabrias at Rages of Media. And fear not, my child, because we are made poor. You have much wealth, if you fear God, and depart from all sin, and do that which is pleasing in his sight.”

### Chapter 5

Then Tobias answered and said to him, “Father, I will do all things, whatever you have commanded me. But how could I receive the money, since I don’t know him?”

He gave him the handwriting, and said to him, “Seek a man who will go with you, and I will give him wages, while I still live; and go and receive the money.”

He went to seek a man, and found Raphael who was an angel; and he didn’t know it. He said to him, “Can I go with you to Rages of Media? Do you know those places well?”

The angel said to him, “I will go with you. I know the way well. I have lodged with our brother Gabael.”

Tobias said to him, “Wait for me, and I will tell my father.”

He said to him, “Go, and don’t wait. And he went in and said to his father, “Behold, I have found someone who will go with me.”

But he said, “Call him to me, that I may know of what tribe he is, and whether he be a trustworthy man to go with you.”

So he called him, and he came in, and they saluted one another. And Tobit said to him, “Brother, of what tribe and of what family are you? Tell me.”

He said to him, “Do you seek a tribe and a family, or a hired man which will go with your son?”

And Tobit said to him, “I want to know, brother, your kindred and your name.”

And he said, “I am Azarias, the son of Ananias the great, of your kindred.”

And he said to him, “Welcome, brother. Don’t be angry with me, because I sought to know your tribe and family. You are my brother, of an honest and good lineage; for I knew Ananias and Jathan, the sons of Shemaiah the great, when we went together to Jerusalem to worship, and offered the firstborn, and the tenths of our increase; and they didn’t go astray in the error of our kindred. My brother, you are of a great stock. But tell me, what wages shall I give you? A drachma a day, and those things that be necessary for you, as to my son? And moreover, if you both return safe and sound, I will add something to your wages.”

And so they agreed. And he said to Tobias, “Prepare yourself for the journey. May God prosper you.” So his son prepared what was needful for the journey, and his father said to him, “Go with this man; but God, who dwells in heaven, will prosper your journey. May his angel go with you.”

Then they both departed, and the young man’s dog went with them. But Anna his mother wept, and said to Tobit, “Why have you sent away our child? Isn’t he the staff of our hand, in going in and out before us? Don’t be greedy to add money to money; but let it be as refuse compared to our child. For what the Lord has given us to live is enough for us.”

Tobit said to her, “Don’t worry, my sister. He will return safe and sound, and your eyes will see him. For a good angel will go with him. His journey will be prospered, and he will return safe and sound.”

So she stopped weeping.

### Chapter 6

Now as they went on their journey, they came at evening to the river Tigris, and they lodged there. But the young man went down to wash himself, and a fish leaped out of the river, and would have swallowed up the young man. But the angel said to him, “Grab the fish!”

So the young man grabbed the fish, and hauled it up onto the land.

And the angel said to him, “Cut the fish open, and take the heart, the liver, and the bile, and keep them with you.” And the young man did as the angel commanded him; but they roasted the fish, and ate it. And they both went on their way, till they drew near to Ecbatana.

The young man said to the angel, “Brother Azarias, of what use is the heart, the liver, and the bile of the fish?”

He said to him, “About the heart and the liver: If a demon or an evil spirit troubles anyone, we must burn those and make smoke of them before the man or the woman, and the affliction will flee. But as for the bile, it is good to anoint a man that has white films in his eyes, and he will be healed.”

But when they drew near to Rages, the angel said to the young man, “Brother, today we will lodge with Raguel. He is your kinsman. He has an only daughter named Sarah. I will speak about her, that she should be given to you for a wife. For her inheritance belongs to you, and you only are of her kindred. The maid is fair and wise. And now hear me, and I will speak to her father. When we return from Rages we will celebrate the marriage; for I know that Raguel may in no way marry her to another according to the law of Moses, or else he would be liable to death, because it belongs to you to take the inheritance, rather than any other.”

Then the young man said to the angel, “Brother Azarias, I have heard that this maid has been given to seven men, and that they all perished in the bride-chamber. Now I am the only son of my father, and I am afraid, lest I go in and die, even as those before me. For a demon loves her, which harms no man, but those which come to her. Now I fear lest I die, and bring my father’s and my mother’s life to the grave with sorrow because of me. They have no other son to bury them.”

But the angel said to him, “Don’t you remember the words which your father commanded you, that you should take a wife of your own kindred? Now hear me, brother; for she will be your wife. Don’t worry about the demon; for this night she will be given you as wife. And when you come into the bride-chamber, you shall take the ashes of incense, and shall lay upon them some of the heart and liver of the fish, and shall make smoke with them. The demon will smell it, and flee away, and never come again any more. But when you go near to her, both of you rise up, and cry to God who is merciful. He will save you, and have mercy on you. Don’t be afraid, for she was prepared for you from the beginning; and you will save her, and she will go with you. And I suppose that you will have children with her.”

When Tobias heard these things, he loved her, and his soul was strongly joined to her.

### Chapter 7

They came to Ecbatana, and arrived at the house of Raguel. But Sarah met them; and she greeted them, and they her. Then she brought them into the house. Raguel said to Edna his wife, “This young man really resembles Tobit my cousin!” And Raguel asked them, “Where are you two from, kindred?”

They said to him, “We are of the sons of Naphtali, who are captives in Nineveh.”

He said to them, “Do you know Tobit our brother?”

They said, “We know him.”

Then he said to them, “Is he in good health?”

They said, “He is both alive, and in good health.” Tobias said, “He is my father.”

And Raguel sprang up, and kissed him, wept, blessed him, and said to him, “You are the son of an honest and good man.” When he had heard that Tobit had lost his sight, he was grieved, and wept; and Edna his wife and Sarah his daughter wept. They received them gladly; and they killed a ram of the flock, and served them meat.

But Tobias said to Raphael, “Brother Azarias, speak of those things of which you talked about in the way, and let the matter be finished.”

So he communicated the thing to Raguel. Raguel said to Tobias, “Eat, drink, and make merry: for it belongs to you to take my child. However I will tell you the truth. I have given my child to seven men of our relatives, and whenever they came in to her, they died in the night. But for the present be merry.”

And Tobias said, “I will taste nothing here, until you all make a covenant and enter into that covenant with me.”

Raguel said, “Take her to yourself from now on according to custom. You are her relative, and she is yours. The merciful God will give all good success to you.” And he called his daughter Sarah, and took her by the hand, and gave her to be wife of Tobias, and said, “Behold, take her to yourself after the law of Moses, and lead her away to your father.” And he blessed them. He called Edna his wife, then took a book, wrote a contract, and sealed it. Then they began to eat.

And Raguel called his wife Edna, and said to her, “Sister, prepare the other chamber, and bring her in there.” She did as he asked her, and brought her in there. She wept, and she received the tears of her daughter, and said to her, “Be comforted, my child. May the Lord of heaven and earth give you favor for this your sorrow. Be comforted, my daughter.”

### Chapter 8

When they had finished their supper, they brought Tobias in to her. But as he went, he remembered the words of Raphael, and took the ashes of the incense, and put the heart and the liver of the fish on them, and made smoke with them. When the demon smelled that smell, it fled into the uppermost parts of Egypt, and the angel bound him. But after they were both shut in together, Tobias rose up from the bed, and said, “Sister, arise, and let’s pray that the Lord may have mercy on us.” And Tobias began to say, “Blessed are you, O God of our fathers, and blessed is your holy and glorious name forever. Let the heavens bless you, and all your creatures. You made Adam, and gave him Eve his wife for a helper and support. From them came the seed of men. You said, it is not good that the man should be alone. Let’s make him a helper like him. And now, O Lord, I take not this my sister for lust, but in truth. Command that I may find mercy and grow old with her.”

She said with him, “Amen.” And they both slept that night.

Raguel arose, and went and dug a grave, saying, “Lest he also should die.” And Raguel came into his house, and said to Edna his wife, “Send one of the maidservants, and let them see if he is alive. If not, we will bury him, and no man will know it.”

So the maidservant opened the door, and went in, and found them both sleeping, and came out, and told them that he was alive.

Then Raguel blessed God, saying, “Blessed are you, O God, with all pure and holy blessing! Let your saints bless you, and all your creatures! Let all your angels and your elect bless you forever! Blessed are you, because you have made me glad; and it has not happened to me as I suspected; but you have dealt with us according to your great mercy. Blessed are you, because you have had mercy on two that were the only begotten children of their parents. Show them mercy, O Lord. Fulfill their life in health with gladness and mercy.

He commanded his servants to fill the grave. He kept the wedding feast for them fourteen days. Before the days of the wedding feast were finished, Raguel sware to him, that he should not depart till the fourteen days of the wedding feast were fulfilled; and that then he should take half of his goods, and go in safety to his father; and the rest, said he, when my wife and I die.

### Chapter 9

And Tobias called Raphael, and said to him, “Brother Azarias, take with you a servant and two camels, and go to Rages of Media to Gabael, and receive the money for me, and bring him to the wedding feast, because Raguel has sworn that I must not depart. My father counts the days; and if I wait long, he will be very grieved. So Raphael went on his way, and lodged with Gabael, and gave him the handwriting; so he brought forth the bags with their seals, and gave them to him. Then they rose up early in the morning together, and came to the wedding feast. Tobias blessed his wife.

### Chapter 10

Tobit his father counted every day. When the days of the journey were expired, and they didn’t come, he said, “Is he perchance detained? Or is Gabael perchance dead, and there is no one to give him the money?” He was very grieved.

But his wife said to him, “The child has perished, seeing he waits long.” She began to bewail him, and said, “I care about nothing, my child, since I have let you go, the light of my eyes.” Tobit said to her, “Hold your peace. Don’t worry. He is in good health.”

And she said to him, “Hold your peace. Don’t deceive me. My child has perished.” And she went out every day into the way by which they went, and ate no bread in the day-time, and didn’t stop bewailing her son Tobias for whole nights, until the fourteen days of the wedding feast were expired, which Raguel had sworn that he should spend there.

Then Tobias said to Raguel, “Send me away, for my father and my mother look no more to see me.” But his father-in-law said to him, “Stay with me, and I will send to your father, and they will declare to him how things go with you.” Tobias said, “No. Send me away to my father.”

Raguel arose, and gave him Sarah his wife, and half his goods, servants and cattle and money; and he blessed them, and sent them away, saying, “The God of heaven will prosper you, my children, before I die.” And he said to his daughter, “Honor your father-in-law and your mother-in-law. They are now your parents. Let me hear a good report of you.” Then he kissed her.

Edna said to Tobias, “May the Lord of heaven restore you, dear brother, and grant to me that I may see your children of my daughter Sarah, that I may rejoice before the Lord. Behold, I commit my daughter to you in special trust. Don’t cause her grief.

### Chapter 11

After these things Tobias also went his way, blessing God because he had prospered his journey; and he blessed Raguel and Edna his wife. Then he went on his way until they drew near to Nineveh. Raphael said to Tobias, “Don’t you know, brother, how you left your father? Let’s run forward before your wife, and prepare the house. But take in your hand the bile of the fish.” So they went their way, and the dog went after them.

Anna sat looking around toward the path for her son. She saw him coming, and said to his father, “Behold, your son is coming with the man that went with him!”

Raphael said, “I know, Tobias, that your father will open his eyes. Therefore anoint his eyes with the bile, and being pricked with it, he will rub, and will make the white films fall away. Then he will see you.”

Anna ran to him, and fell upon the neck of her son, and said to him, “I have seen you, my child! I am ready to die.” They both wept.

Tobit went toward the door and stumbled; but his son ran to him, and took hold of his father. He rubbed the bile on his father’s eyes, saying, “Cheer up, my father.” When his eyes began to hurt, he rubbed them. Then the white films peeled away from the corners of his eyes; and he saw his son, and fell upon his neck.

He wept, and said, “Blessed are you, O God, and blessed is your name forever! Blessed are all your holy angels! For you scourged, and had mercy on me. Behold, I see my son Tobias.” And his son went in rejoicing, and told his father the great things that had happened to him in Media.

Tobit went out to meet his daughter-in-law at the gate of Nineveh, rejoicing and blessing God. Those who saw him go marveled, because he had received his sight. Tobit gave thanks before them, because God had shown mercy on him. When Tobit came near to Sarah his daughter-in-law, he blessed her, saying, “Welcome, daughter! Blessed is God who has brought you to us, and blessed are your father and your mother.” And there was joy among all his kindred who were at Nineveh. Achiacharus and Nasbas his brother’s son came. Tobias’ wedding feast was kept seven days with great gladness.

### Chapter 12

And Tobit called his son Tobias, and said to him, “See, my child, that the man which went with you have his wages, and you must give him more.”

And he said to him, “Father, it is no harm to me to give him the half of those things which I have brought; for he has led me for you in safety, and he cured my wife, and brought my money, and likewise cured you.”

The old man said, “It is due to him.”

And he called the angel, and said to him, “Take half of all that you have brought.”

Then he called them both privately, and said to them, “Bless God, and give him thanks, and magnify him, and give him thanks in the sight of all that live, for the things which he has done with you. It is good to bless God and exalt his name, showing forth with honor the works of God. Don’t be slack to give him thanks. It is good to conceal the secret of a king, but to reveal gloriously the works of God. Do good, and evil won’t find you. Good is prayer with fasting, alms, and righteousness. A little with righteousness is better than much with unrighteousness. It is better to give alms than to lay up gold. Alms delivers from death, and it purges away all sin. Those who give alms and do righteousness will be filled with life; but those who sin are enemies to their own life. Surely I will conceal nothing from you. I have said, ‘It is good to conceal the secret of a king, but to reveal gloriously the works of God.’ And now, when you prayed, and Sarah your daughter-in-law, I brought the memorial of your prayer before the Holy One. When you buried the dead, I was with you likewise. And when you didn’t delay to rise up, and leave your dinner, that you might go and cover the dead, your good deed was not hidden from me. I was with you. And now God sent me to heal you and Sarah your daughter-in-law. I am Raphael, one of the seven holy angels which present the prayers of the saints and go in before the glory of the Holy One.”

And they were both troubled, and fell upon their faces; for they were afraid. And he said to them, “Don’t be afraid. You will all have peace; but bless God forever. For I came not of any favor of my own, but by the will of your God. Therefore bless him forever. All these days I appeared to you. I didn’t eat or drink, but you all saw a vision. Now give God thanks, because I ascend to him who sent me. Write in a book all the things which have been done.” Then they rose up, and saw him no more. They confessed the great and wonderful works of God, and how the angel of the Lord had appeared to them.

### Chapter 13

And Tobit wrote a prayer for rejoicing, and said,

“Blessed is God who lives forever!

Blessed is his kingdom!

For he scourges, and shows mercy.

He leads down to the grave, and brings up again.

There is no one who will escape his hand.

Give thanks to him before the Gentiles, all you children of Israel!

For he has scattered us among them.

Declare his greatness, there.

Extol him before all the living,

because he is our Lord,

and God is our Father forever.

He will scourge us for our iniquities, and will again show mercy,

and will gather us out of all the nations among whom you are all scattered.

If you turn to him with your whole heart and with your whole soul,

to do truth before him,

then he will turn to you,

and won’t hide his face from you.

See what he will do with you.

Give him thanks with your whole mouth.

Bless the Lord of righteousness.

Exalt the everlasting King.

I give him thanks in the land of my captivity,

and show his strength and majesty to a nation of sinners.

Turn, you sinners, and do righteousness before him.

Who can tell if he will accept you and have mercy on you?

I exalt my God.

My soul exalts the King of heaven,

and rejoices in his greatness.

Let all men speak,

and let them give him thanks in Jerusalem.

O Jerusalem, the holy city,

he will scourge you for the works of your sons,

and will again have mercy on the sons of the righteous.

Give thanks to the Lord with goodness,

and bless the everlasting King,

that his tabernacle may be built in you again with joy,

and that he may make glad in you those who are captives,

and love in you forever those who are miserable.

Many nations will come from afar to the name of the Lord God

with gifts in their hands, even gifts to the King of heaven.

Generations of generations will praise you,

and sing songs of rejoicing.

All those who hate you are cursed.

All those who love you forever will be blessed.

Rejoice and be exceedingly glad for the sons of the righteous;

for they will be gathered together and will bless the Lord of the righteous.

Oh blessed are those who love you.

They will rejoice for your peace.

Blessed are all those who mourned for all your scourges;

because they will rejoice for you when they have seen all your glory.

They will be made glad forever.

Let my soul bless God the great King.

For Jerusalem will be built with sapphires, emeralds, and precious stones;

your walls and towers and battlements with pure gold.

The streets of Jerusalem will be paved with beryl, carbuncle, and stones of Ophir.

All her streets will say, “Hallelujah!”

and give praise, saying, “Blessed be God, who has exalted you forever!”

### Chapter 14

Then Tobit finished giving thanks. He was fifty-eight years old when he lost his sight. After eight years, he received it again. He gave alms and he feared the Lord God more and more, and gave thanks to him.

Now he grew very old; and he called his son with the six sons of his son, and said to him, “My child, take your sons. Behold, I have grown old, and am ready to depart out of this life. Go into Media, my child, for I surely believe all the things which Jonah the prophet spoke of Nineveh, that it will be overthrown, but in Media there will rather be peace for a season. Our kindred will be scattered in the earth from the good land. Jerusalem will be desolate, and the house of God in it will be burned up, and will be desolate for a time. God will again have mercy on them, and bring them back into the land, and they will build the house, but not like to the former house, until the times of that age are fulfilled. Afterward they will return from the places of their captivity, and build up Jerusalem with honor. The house of God will be built in it forever with a glorious building, even as the prophets spoke concerning it. And all the nations will turn to fear the Lord God truly, and will bury their idols. All the nations will bless the Lord, and his people will give thanks to God, and the Lord will exalt his people; and all those who love the Lord God in truth and righteousness will rejoice, showing mercy to our kindred. And now, my child, depart from Nineveh, because those things which the prophet Jonah spoke will surely come to pass. But you must keep the law and the ordinances, and show yourself merciful and righteous, that it may be well with you. Bury me decently, and your mother with me. Don’t stay at Nineveh. See, my child, what Aman did to Achiacharus who nourished him, how out of light he brought him into darkness, and all the recompense that he made him. Achiacharus was saved, but the other had his recompense, and he went down into darkness. Manasses gave alms, and escaped the snare of death which he set for him; but Aman fell into the snare, and perished. And now, my children, consider what alms does, and how righteousness delivers.”

While he was saying these things, he gave up the ghost in the bed; but he was one hundred fifty eight years old. Tobias buried him magnificently. When Anna died, he buried her with his father. But Tobias departed with his wife and his sons to Ecbatana to Raguel his father-in-law, and he grew old in honor, and he buried his father-in-law and mother-in-law magnificently, and he inherited their possessions, and his father Tobit’s. He died at Ecbatana of Media, being one hundred twenty seven years old. Before he died, he heard of the destruction of Nineveh, which Nebuchadnezzar and Ahasuerus took captive. Before his death, he rejoiced over Nineveh.

## Judith

Judith is recognized as Deuterocanonical Scripture by the Roman Catholic, Greek Orthodox, and Russian Orthodox Churches.

### Chapter 1

In the twelfth year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar, who reigned over the Assyrians in Nineveh, the great city, in the days of Arphaxad, who reigned over the Medes in Ecbatana, and built around Ecbatana walls of hewn stones three cubits broad and six cubits long, and made the height of the wall seventy cubits, and its breadth fifty cubits, and set its towers at its gates one hundred cubits high, and its breadth in the foundation was sixty cubits, and made its gates, even gates that were raised to the height of seventy cubits, and their breadth forty cubits, for his mighty army to go out of, and the setting in array of his footmen— in those days King Nebuchadnezzar made war with King Arphaxad in the great plain. This plain is on the borders of Ragau. There came to meet him all that lived in the hill country, and all that lived by Euphrates, Tigris, and Hydaspes, and in the plain of Arioch the king of the Elymaeans. Many nations of the sons of Chelod assembled themselves to the battle.

And Nebuchadnezzar king of the Assyrians sent to all who lived in Persia, and to all who lived westward, to those who lived in Cilicia, Damascus, Libanus, Antilibanus, and to all who lived along the sea coast, and to those among the nations that were of Carmel and Gilead, and to the higher Galilee and the great plain of Esdraelon, and to all who were in Samaria and its cities, and beyond Jordan to Jerusalem, Betane, Chellus, Kadesh, the river of Egypt, Tahpanhes, Rameses, and all the land of Goshen, until you come above Tanis and Memphis, and to all that lived in Egypt, until you come to the borders of Ethiopia. All those who lived in all the land made light of the commandment of Nebuchadnezzar king of the Assyrians, and didn’t go with him to the war; for they were not afraid of him, but he was before them as one man. They turned away his messengers from their presence without effect, and with disgrace.

And Nebuchadnezzar was exceedingly angry with all this land, and he swore by his throne and kingdom that he would surely be avenged upon all the coasts of Cilicia, Damascus, and Syria, that he would kill with his sword all the inhabitants of the land of Moab, the children of Ammon, all Judea, and all who were in Egypt, until you come to the borders of the two seas. And he set the battle in array with his army against King Arphaxad in the seventeenth year; and he prevailed in his battle, and turned to flight all the army of Arphaxad, with all his horses and all his chariots. He took possession of his cities. He came to Ecbatana and took the towers, plundered its streets, and turned its beauty into shame. He took Arphaxad in the mountains of Ragau, struck him through with his darts, and utterly destroyed him to this day. He returned with them to Nineveh, he and all his company of sundry nations—an exceedingly great multitude of men of war. There he took his ease and banqueted, he and his army, for one hundred twenty days.

### Chapter 2

In the eighteenth year, the twenty-second day of the first month, there was talk in the house of Nebuchadnezzar king of the Assyrians that he should be avenged on all the land, even as he spoke. He called together all his servants and all his great men, and communicated with them his secret counsel, and with his own mouth, recounted the wickedness of all the land. They decreed to destroy all flesh which didn’t follow the word of his mouth.

It came to pass, when he had ended his counsel, Nebuchadnezzar king of the Assyrians called Holofernes the chief captain of his army, who was second to himself, and said to him, “The great king, the lord of all the earth, says: ‘Behold, you shall go out from my presence, and take with you men who trust in their strength, to one hundred twenty thousand footmen and twelve thousand horses with their riders. And you shall go out against all the west country, because they disobeyed the commandment of my mouth. You shall declare to them that they should prepare earth and water, because I will go out in my wrath against them, and will cover the whole face of the earth with the feet of my army, who will plunder them. Their slain will fill their valleys and brooks, and the river will be filled with their dead until it overflows. I will lead them as captives to the utmost parts of all the earth. But you shall go forth, and take all their coasts for me first. If they will yield themselves to you, then you must reserve them for me until the day of their reproof. As for those who resist, your eye shall not spare; but you shall give them up to be slain and to be plundered in all your land. For as I live, and by the power of my kingdom, I have spoken, and I will do this with my hand. Moreover, you shall not transgress anything of the commandments of your lord, but you shall surely accomplish them, as I have commanded you. You shall not defer to do them.’”

So Holofernes went out from the presence of his lord, and called all the governors, the captains, and officers of the army of Asshur. He counted chosen men for the battle, as his lord had commanded him, to one hundred twenty thousand, with twelve thousand archers on horseback. He arranged them as a great multitude is ordered for the war. He took camels, donkeys, and mules for their baggage, an exceedingly great multitude, and sheep, oxen, and goats without number for their provision, and a large supply of rations for every man, and a huge amount of gold and silver out of the king’s house. He went out, he and all his army, on their journey, to go before King Nebuchadnezzar, and to cover all the face of the earth westward with their chariots, horsemen, and chosen footmen. A great company of various nations went out with them like locusts and like the sand of the earth. For they could not be counted by reason of their multitude.

And they departed out of Nineveh three days’ journey toward the plain of Bectileth, and encamped from Bectileth near the mountain which is at the left hand of the Upper Cilicia. And he took all his army, his footmen, horsemen, and chariots, and went away from there into the hill country, and destroyed Put and Lud, and plundered all the children of Rasses and the children of Ishmael, which were along the wilderness to the south of the land of the Chellians. And he went over Euphrates, and went through Mesopotamia, and broke down all the high cities that were upon the river Arbonai, until you come to the sea. And he took possession of the borders of Cilicia, and killed all who resisted him, and came to the borders of Japheth, which were toward the south, opposite Arabia. He surrounded all the children of Midian, and set their tents on fire, and plundered their sheepfolds. He went down into the plain of Damascus in the days of wheat harvest, and set all their fields on fire, and utterly destroyed their flocks and herds, plundered their cities, laid their plains waste, and struck all their young men with the edge of the sword.

And the fear and the dread of him fell upon those who lived on the sea coast, upon those who were in Sidon and Tyre, those who lived in Sur and Ocina, and all who lived in Jemnaan. Those who lived in Azotus and Ascalon feared him exceedingly.

### Chapter 3

And they sent to him messengers with words of peace, saying, “Behold, we the servants of Nebuchadnezzar the great king lie before you. Use us as it is pleasing in your sight. Behold, our dwellings, and all our country, and all our fields of wheat, and our flocks and herds, and all the sheepfolds of our tents, lie before your face. Use them as it may please you. Behold, even our cities and those who dwell in them are your servants. Come and deal with them as it is good in your eyes.”

So the men came to Holofernes, and declared to him according to these words.

He came down toward the sea coast, he and his army, and set garrisons in the high cities, and took out of them chosen men for allies. They received him, they and all the country round about them, with garlands and dances and timbrels. He cast down all their borders, and cut down their sacred groves. It had been given to him to destroy all the gods of the land, that all the nations would worship Nebuchadnezzar only, and that all their tongues and their tribes would call upon him as a god.

Then he came toward Esdraelon near to Dotaea, which is opposite the great ridge of Judea. He encamped between Geba and Scythopolis. He was there a whole month, that he might gather together all the baggage of his army.

### Chapter 4

The children of Israel who lived in Judea heard all that Holofernes the chief captain of Nebuchadnezzar king of the Assyrians had done to the nations, and how he had plundered all their temples and destroyed them utterly. They were exceedingly afraid at his approach, and were troubled for Jerusalem and for the temple of the Lord their God; because they had newly come up from the captivity, and all the people of Judea were recently gathered together; and the vessels, the altar, and the house were sanctified after being profaned.

And they sent into every coast of Samaria, to Konae, to Beth-horon, Belmaim, Jericho, to Choba, Aesora, and to the valley of Salem; and they occupied beforehand all the tops of the high mountains, fortified the villages that were in them, and stored supplies for the provision of war, for their fields were newly reaped. Joakim the high priest, who was in those days at Jerusalem, wrote to those who lived in Bethulia and Betomesthaim, which is opposite Esdraelon toward the plain that is near to Dothaim, charging them to seize upon the ascents of the hill country; because by them was the entrance into Judea, and it was easy to stop them from approaching, inasmuch as the approach was narrow, with space for two men at the most. And the children of Israel did as Joakim the high priest had commanded them, as did the senate of all the people of Israel, which was in session at Jerusalem.

And every man of Israel cried to God with great earnestness, and with great earnestness they humbled their souls. They, their wives, their children, their cattle, and every sojourner, hireling, and servant bought with their money put sackcloth on their loins. Every man and woman of Israel, including the little children and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, fell prostrate before the temple, cast ashes upon their heads, and spread out their sackcloth before the Lord. They put sackcloth around the altar. They cried to the God of Israel earnestly with one consent, that he would not give their children as prey, their wives as plunder, the cities of their inheritance to destruction, and the sanctuary to being profaned and being made a reproach, for the nations to rejoice at. The Lord heard their voice, and looked at their affliction. The people continued fasting many days in all Judea and Jerusalem before the sanctuary of the Lord Almighty. And Joakim the high priest, and all the priests who stood before the Lord, and those who ministered to the Lord, had their loins dressed in sackcloth and offered the continual burnt offering, the vows, and the free gifts of the people. They had ashes on their turbans. They cried to the Lord with all their power, that he would look upon all the house of Israel for good.

### Chapter 5

Holofernes, the chief captain of the army of Asshur, was told that the children of Israel had prepared for war, had shut up the passages of the hill country, had fortified all the tops of the high hills, and had set up barricades in the plains. Then he was exceedingly angry, and he called all the princes of Moab, the captains of Ammon, and all the governors of the sea coast, and he said to them, “Tell me now, you sons of Canaan, who are these people who dwell in the hill country? What are the cities that they inhabit? How large is their army? Where is their power and their strength? What king is set over them, to be the leader of their army? Why have they turned their backs, that they should not come and meet me, more than all who dwell in the west?”

Then Achior, the leader of all the children of Ammon, said to him, “Let my lord now hear a word from the mouth of your servant, and I will tell you the truth concerning these people who dwell in this hill country, near to the place where you dwell. No lie will come out of the mouth of your servant. These people are descended from the Chaldeans. They sojourned before this in Mesopotamia, because they didn’t want to follow the gods of their fathers, which were in the land of the Chaldeans. They departed from the way of their parents, and worshiped the God of heaven, the God whom they knew. Their parents cast them out from the face of their gods, and they fled into Mesopotamia and sojourned there many days. Then their God commanded them to depart from the place where they sojourned, and to go into the land of Canaan. They lived there, and prospered with gold and silver, and with exceedingly much cattle. Then they went down into Egypt, for a famine covered all the land of Canaan. They sojourned there until they had grown up. They became a great multitude there, so that one could not count the population of their nation. Then the king of Egypt rose up against them, and dealt subtly with them, and brought them low, making them labor in brick, and made them slaves. They cried to their God, and he struck all the land of Egypt with incurable plagues; so the Egyptians cast them out of their sight. God dried up the Red sea before them, and brought them into the way of Sinai Kadesh-Barnea and they cast out all that lived in the wilderness. They lived in the land of the Amorites, and they destroyed by their strength everyone in Heshbon. Passing over Jordan, they possessed all the hill country. They cast out before them the Canaanite, the Perizzite, the Jebusite, the Shechemite, and all the Girgashites, and they lived in that country many days.

And while they didn’t sin before their God, they prospered, because God who hates iniquity was with them. But when they departed from the way which he appointed them, they were destroyed in many severe battles, and were led captives into a land that was not theirs. The temple of their God was razed to the ground, and their cities were taken by their adversaries. And now they have returned to their God, and have come up from the dispersion where they were dispersed, and have possessed Jerusalem, where their sanctuary is, and are settled in the hill country; for it was desolate.

And now, my lord and master, if there is any error in this people, and they sin against their God, we will find out what this thing is in which they stumble, and we will go up and overcome them. But if there is no lawlessness in their nation, let my lord now pass by, lest their Lord defend them, and their God be for them, and we will be a reproach before all the earth.”

It came to pass, when Achior had finished speaking these words, all the people standing around the tent complained. The great men of Holofernes, and all who lived by the sea side and in Moab, said that he should be cut to pieces. For, they said, “We will not be afraid of the children of Israel, because, behold, they are a people that has no power nor might to make the battle strong. Therefore now we will go up, and they will be a prey to be devoured by all your army, Lord Holofernes.”

### Chapter 6

And when the disturbance of the men that were around the council had ceased, Holofernes the chief captain of the army of Asshur said to Achior and to all the children of Moab before all the people of the foreigners:

“And who are you, Achior, and the mercenaries of Ephraim, that you have prophesied among us as today, and have said that we should not make war with the race of Israel, because their God will defend them? And who is God but Nebuchadnezzar? He will send forth his might, and will destroy them from the face of the earth, and their God will not deliver them; but we his servants will strike them as one man. They will not sustain the might of our cavalry. For with them we will burn them up. Their mountains will be drunken with their blood. Their plains will be filled with their dead bodies. Their footsteps will not stand before us, but they will surely perish, says King Nebuchadnezzar, lord of all the earth; for he said, ‘The words that I have spoken will not be in vain.’

But you, Achior, hireling of Ammon, who have spoken these words in the day of your iniquity, will see my face no more from this day, until I am avenged of the race of those that came out of Egypt. And then the sword of my army, and the multitude of those who serve me, will pass through your sides, and you will fall among their slain when I return. Then my servants will bring you back into the hill country, and will set you in one of the cities by the passes. You will not perish until you are destroyed with them. And if you hope in your heart that they will not be taken, don’t let your countenance fall. I have spoken it, and none of my words will fall to the ground.”

Then Holofernes commanded his servants who waited in his tent to take Achior, and bring him back to Bethulia, and deliver him into the hands of the children of Israel. So his servants took him, and brought him out of the camp into the plain, and they moved from the midst of the plains into the hill country, and came to the springs that were under Bethulia. When the men of the city saw them on the top of the hill, they took up their weapons, and went out of the city against them to the top of the hill. Every man that used a sling kept them from coming up, and threw stones at them. They took cover under the hill, bound Achior, cast him down, left him at the foot of the hill, and went away to their lord.

But the children of Israel descended from their city, and came to him, untied him, led him away into Bethulia, and presented him to the rulers of their city, which were in those days Ozias the son of Micah, of the tribe of Simeon, and Chabris the son of Gothoniel, and Charmis the son of Melchiel. Then they called together all the elders of the city; and all their young men ran together, with their women, to the assembly. They set Achior in the midst of all their people. Then Ozias asked him what had happened. He answered and declared to them the words of the council of Holofernes, and all the words that he had spoken in the midst of the princes of the children of Asshur, and all the great words that Holofernes had spoken against the house of Israel. Then the people fell down and worshiped God, and cried, saying, “O Lord God of heaven, behold their arrogance, and pity the low estate of our race. Look upon the face of those who are sanctified to you this day.” They comforted Achior, and praised him exceedingly. Then Ozias took him out of the assembly into his house, and made a feast for the elders. They called on the God of Israel for help all that night.

### Chapter 7

The next day Holofernes commanded all his army and all the people who had come to be his allies, that they should move their camp toward Bethulia, seize the passes of the hill country, and make war against the children of Israel. Every mighty man of them moved that day. The army of their men of war was one hundred seventy thousand footmen, plus twelve thousand horsemen, besides the baggage and the men who were on foot among them—an exceedingly great multitude. They encamped in the valley near Bethulia, by the fountain. They spread themselves in breadth over Dothaim even to Belmaim, and in length from Bethulia to Cyamon, which is near Esdraelon.

But the children of Israel, when they saw the multitude of them, were terrified, and everyone said to his neighbor, “Now these men will lick up the face of all the earth. Neither the high mountains, nor the valleys, nor the hills will be able to bear their weight. Every man took up his weapons of war, and when they had kindled fires upon their towers, they remained and watched all that night.

But on the second day Holofernes led out all his cavalry in the sight of the children of Israel which were in Bethulia, viewed the ascents to their city, and searched out the springs of the waters, seized upon them, and set garrisons of men of war over them. Then he departed back to his people.

All the rulers of the children of Esau, all the leaders of the people of Moab, and the captains of the sea coast came to him and said, “Let our lord now hear a word, that there not be losses in your army. For this people of the children of Israel do not trust in their spears, but in the height of the mountains wherein they dwell, for it is not easy to come up to the tops of their mountains. And now, my lord, don’t fight against them as men fight who join battle, and there will not so much as one man of your people perish. Remain in your camp, and keep every man of your army safe. Let your servants get possession of the water spring, which flows from the foot of the mountain, because all the inhabitants of Bethulia get their water from there. Then thirst will kill them, and they will give up their city. Then we and our people will go up to the tops of the mountains that are near, and will camp upon them, to watch that not one man gets out of the city. They will be consumed with famine—they, their wives, and their children. Before the sword comes against them they will be laid low in the streets where they dwell. And you will pay them back with evil, because they rebelled, and didn’t meet your face in peace.”

Their words were pleasing in the sight of Holofernes and in the sight of all his servants; and he ordered them to do as they had spoken. And the army of the children of Ammon moved, and with them five thousand of the children of Asshur, and they encamped in the valley. They seized the waters and the springs of the waters of the children of Israel. The children of Esau went up with the children of Ammon, and encamped in the hill country near Dothaim. They sent some of them toward the south, and toward the east, near Ekrebel, which is near Chusi, that is upon the brook Mochmur. The rest of the army of the Assyrians encamped in the plain, and covered all the face of the land. Their tents and baggage were pitched upon it in a great crowd. They were an exceedingly great multitude.

The children of Israel cried to the Lord their God, for their spirit fainted; for all their enemies had surrounded them. There was no way to escape out from among them. All the army of Asshur remained around them, their footmen and their chariots and their horsemen, for thirty-four days. All their vessels of water ran dry for all the inhabitants of Bethulia. The cisterns were emptied, and they had no water to drink their fill for one day; for they rationed drink by measure. Their young children were discouraged. The women and the young men fainted for thirst. They fell down in the streets of the city, and in the passages of the gates. There was no longer any strength in them.

All the people, including the young men, the women, and the children, were gathered together against Ozias, and against the rulers of the city. They cried with a loud voice, and said before all the elders, “God be judge between all of you and us, because you have done us great wrong, in that you have not spoken words of peace with the children of Asshur. Now we have no helper; but God has sold us into their hands, that we should be laid low before them with thirst and great destruction. And now summon them, and deliver up the whole city as prey to the people of Holofernes, and to all his army. For it is better for us to be captured by them. For we will be servants, and our souls will live, and we will not see the death of our babies before our eyes, and our wives and our children fainting in death. We take to witness against you the heaven and the earth, and our God and the Lord of our fathers, who punishes us according to our sins and the sins of our fathers. Do what we have said today!”

And there was great weeping of all with one consent in the midst of the assembly; and they cried to the Lord God with a loud voice. And Ozias said to them, “Brethren, be of good courage! Let us endure five more days, during which the Lord our God will turn his mercy toward us; for he will not forsake us utterly. But if these days pass, and no help comes to us, I will do what you say.” Then he dispersed the people, every man to his own camp; and they went away to the walls and towers of their city. He sent the women and children into their houses. They were brought very low in the city.

### Chapter 8

In those days Judith heard about this. She was the daughter of Merari, the son of Ox, the son of Joseph, the son of Oziel, the son of Elkiah, the son of Ananias, the son of Gideon, the son of Raphaim, the son of Ahitub, the son of Elihu, the son of Eliab, the son of Nathanael, the son of Salamiel, the son of Salasadai, the son of Israel. Her husband was Manasses, of her tribe and of her family. He died in the days of barley harvest. For he stood over those who bound sheaves in the field, and was overcome by the burning heat, and he fell on his bed, and died in his city Bethulia. So they buried him with his fathers in the field which is between Dothaim and Balamon. Judith was a widow in her house three years and four months. She made herself a tent upon the roof of her house, and put on sackcloth upon her loins. The garments of her widowhood were upon her. And she fasted all the days of her widowhood, except the eves of the Sabbaths, the Sabbaths, the eves of the new moons, the new moons, and the feasts and joyful days of the house of Israel. She was beautiful in appearance, and lovely to behold. Her husband Manasses had left her gold, silver, menservants, maidservants, cattle, and lands. She remained on those lands. No one said anything evil about her, for she feared God exceedingly.

She heard the evil words of the people against the governor, because they fainted for lack of water; and Judith heard all the words that Ozias spoke to them, how he swore to them that he would deliver the city to the Assyrians after five days. So she sent her maid, who was over all things that she had, to summon Ozias, Chabris, and Charmis, the elders of her city. They came to her, and she said to them, “Hear me now, O you rulers of the inhabitants of Bethulia! For your word that you have spoken before the people this day is not right. You have set the oath which you have pronounced between God and you, and have promised to deliver the city to our enemies, unless within these days the Lord turns to help you. Now who are you that you have tested God this day, and stand in the place of God among the children of men? Now try the Lord Almighty, and you will never know anything. For you will not find the depth of the heart of man, and you will not perceive the things that he thinks. How will you search out God, who has made all these things, and know his mind, and comprehend his purpose? No, my kindred, don’t provoke the Lord our God to anger! For if he has not decided to help us within these five days, he has power to defend us in such time as he will, or to destroy us before the face of our enemies. But don’t you pledge the counsels of the Lord our God! For God is not like a human being, that he should be threatened, neither is he like a son of man, that he should be won over by pleading. Therefore let’s wait for the salvation that comes from him, and call upon him to help us. He will hear our voice, if it pleases him. For there arose none in our age, neither is there any of us today, tribe, or kindred, or family, or city, which worship gods made with hands, as it was in the former days; for which cause our fathers were given to the sword, and for plunder, and fell with a great destruction before our enemies. But we know no other god beside him. Therefore we hope that he will not despise us, nor any of our race. For if we are captured, all Judea will be captured and our sanctuary will be plundered; and he will require our blood for profaning it. The slaughter of our kindred, the captivity of the land, and the desolation of our inheritance, he will bring on our heads among the Gentiles, wherever we will be in bondage. We will be an offense and a reproach to those who take us for a possession. For our bondage will not be ordered to favor; but the Lord our God will turn it to dishonor. And now, kindred, let’s show an example to our kindred, because their soul depends on us, and the sanctuary, the house, and the altar depend on us. Besides all this let’s give thanks to the Lord our God, who tries us, even as he did our fathers also. Remember all the things which he did to Abraham, and all the things in which he tried Isaac, and all the things which happened to Jacob in Mesopotamia of Syria, when he kept the sheep of Laban his mother’s brother. For he has not tried us in the fire, as he did them, to search out their hearts, neither has he taken vengeance on us; but the Lord scourges those who come near to him, to admonish them.”

And Ozias said to her, “All that you have spoken, you have spoken with a good heart. There is no one who will deny your words. For this is not the first day wherein your wisdom is manifested; but from the beginning of your days all the people have known your understanding, because the disposition of your heart is good. But the people were exceedingly thirsty, and compelled us to do as we spoke to them, and to bring an oath upon ourselves, which we will not break. And now pray for us, because you are a godly woman, and the Lord will send us rain to fill our cisterns, and we will faint no more.”

Then Judith said to them, “Hear me, and I will do a thing, which will go down to all generations among the children of our race. You shall all stand at the gate tonight. I will go out with my maid. Within the days after which you said that you would deliver the city to our enemies, the Lord will deliver Israel by my hand. But you shall not inquire of my act; for I will not tell you until the things are finished that I will do.”

Then Ozias and the rulers said to her, “Go in peace. May the Lord God be before you, to take vengeance on our enemies.” So they returned from the tent, and went to their stations.

### Chapter 9

But Judith fell upon her face, and put ashes upon her head, and uncovered the sackcloth with which she was clothed. The incense of that evening was now being offered at Jerusalem in the house of God, and Judith cried to the Lord with a loud voice, and said, “O Lord God of my father Simeon, into whose hand you gave a sword to take vengeance on the strangers who loosened the belt of a virgin to defile her, uncovered her thigh to her shame, and profaned her womb to her reproach; for you said, ‘It shall not be so;’ and they did so. Therefore you gave their rulers to be slain, and their bed, which was ashamed for her who was deceived, to be dyed in blood, and struck the servants with their masters, and the masters upon their thrones; and gave their wives for a prey, and their daughters to be captives, and all their spoils to be divided among your dear children; which were moved with zeal for you, and abhorred the pollution of their blood, and called upon you for aid. O God, O my God, hear me also who am a widow. For you did the things that were before those things, and those things, and such as come after; and you planned the things which are now, and the things which are to come. The things which you planned came to pass. Yes, the things which you determined stood before you, and said, ‘Behold, we are here; for all your ways are prepared, and your judgment is with foreknowledge.’ For, behold, the Assyrians are multiplied in their power. They are exalted with horse and rider. They were proud of the strength of their footmen. They have trusted in shield, spear, bow, and sling. They don’t know that you are the Lord who breaks the battles. ‘The Lord’ is your name. Break their strength in your power, and bring down their force in your wrath; for they intend to profane your sanctuary, and to defile the tabernacle where your glorious name rests, and to destroy the horn of your altar with the sword. Look at their pride, and send your wrath upon their heads. Give into my hand, which am a widow, the might that I have conceived. Strike by the deceit of my lips the servant with the prince, and the prince with his servant. Break down their arrogance by the hand of a woman. For your power stands not in numbers, nor your might in strong men, but you are a God of the afflicted. You are a helper of the oppressed, a helper of the weak, a protector of the forsaken, a savior of those who are without hope. Please, please, God of my father, and God of the inheritance of Israel, Lord of the heavens and of the earth, Creator of the waters, King of all your creation, hear my prayer. Make my speech and deceit to be their wound and bruise, who intend hard things against your covenant, your holy house, the top of Zion, and the house of the possession of your children. Make every nation and tribe of yours to know that you are God, the God of all power and might, and that there is no other who protects the race of Israel but you.”

### Chapter 10

It came to pass, when she had ceased to cry to the God of Israel, and had finished saying all these words, that she rose up where she had fallen down, called her maid, and went down into the house that she lived on the Sabbath days and on her feast days. She pulled off the sackcloth which she had put on, took off the garments of her widowhood, washed her body all over with water, anointed herself with rich ointment, braided the hair of her head, and put a tiara upon it. She put on her garments of gladness, which she used to wear in the days of the life of Manasses her husband. She took sandals for her feet, and put on her anklet, bracelets, rings, earrings, and all her jewelry. She made herself very beautiful to deceive the eyes of all men who would see her. She gave her maid a leather container of wine and a flask of oil, and filled a bag with roasted grain, lumps of figs, and fine bread. She packed all her vessels together, and laid them upon her.

They went out to the gate of the city of Bethulia, and found Ozias and the elders of the city, Chabris and Charmis standing by it. But when they saw her, that her countenance was altered and her apparel was changed, they were greatly astonished by her beauty and said to her, “May the God of our fathers give you favor, and accomplish your purposes to the glory of the children of Israel, and to the exaltation of Jerusalem.”

Then she worshiped God, and said to them, “Command that they open the gate of the city for me, and I will go out to accomplish the things you spoke with me about.”

And they commanded the young men to open to her, as she had spoken; and they did so.

Then Judith went out, she, and her handmaid with her. The men of the city watched her until she had gone down the mountain, until she had passed the valley, and they could see her no more. They went straight onward in the valley. The watch of the Assyrians met her; and they took her, and asked her, “Of what people are you? Where are you coming from? Where are you going?”

She said, “I am a daughter of the Hebrews. I am fleeing away from their presence, because they are about to be given you to be consumed. I am coming into the presence of Holofernes the chief captain of your army, to declare words of truth. I will show him a way that he can go and win all the hill country, and there will not be lacking of his men one person, nor one life.”

Now when the men heard her words, and considered her countenance, the beauty thereof was exceedingly marvelous in their eyes. They said to her, “You have saved your life, in that you have hurried to come down to the presence of our master. Now come to his tent. Some of us will guide you until they deliver you into his hands. But when you stand before him, don’t be afraid in your heart, but declare to him what you just said, and he will treat you well.” They chose out of them a hundred men, and appointed them to accompany her and her maid; and they brought them to the tent of Holofernes.

And there was great excitement throughout all the camp, for her coming was reported among the tents. They came and surrounded her as she stood outside Holofernes’ tent, until they told him about her. They marveled at her beauty, and marveled at the children of Israel because of her. Each one said to his neighbor, “Who would despise these people, who have among them such women? For it is not good that one man of them be left, seeing that, if they are let go, they will be able to deceive the whole earth.

Then the guards of Holofernes and all his servants came out and brought her into the tent. And Holofernes was resting upon his bed under the canopy, which was woven with purple, gold, emeralds, and precious stones. And they told him about her; and he came out into the space before his tent, with silver lamps going before him. But when Judith had come before him and his servants, they all marveled at the beauty of her countenance. She fell down upon her face and bowed down to him, but his servants raised her up.

### Chapter 11

Holofernes said to her, “Woman, take courage. Don’t be afraid in your heart; for I never hurt anyone who has chosen to serve Nebuchadnezzar, the king of all the earth. And now, if your people who dwell in the hill country had not slighted me, I would not have lifted up my spear against them; but they have done these things to themselves. And now tell me why you fled from them and came to us; for you have come to save yourself. Take courage! You will live tonight, and hereafter; for there is no one that will wrong you, but all will treat you well, as is done to the servants of King Nebuchadnezzar my lord.”

And Judith said to him, “Receive the words of your servant, and let your handmaid speak in your presence, and I won’t lie to my lord tonight. If you will follow the words of your handmaid, God will bring the thing to pass perfectly with you; and my lord will not fail to accomplish his purposes. As Nebuchadnezzar king of all the earth lives, and as his power lives, who has sent you for the preservation of every living thing, not only do men serve him by you, but also the beasts of the field, the cattle, and the birds of the sky will live through your strength, in the time of Nebuchadnezzar and of all his house. For we have heard of your wisdom and the subtle plans of your soul. It has been reported in all the earth that you only are brave in all the kingdom, mighty in knowledge, and wonderful in feats of war. And now as concerning the matter which Achior spoke in your council, we have heard his words; for the men of Bethulia saved him, and he declared to them all that he had spoken before you. Therefore, O lord and master, don’t neglect his word, but lay it up in your heart, for it is true; for our race will not be punished, neither will the sword prevail against them, unless they sin against their God. And now, that my lord may not be defeated and frustrated in his purpose, and that death may fall upon them, their sin has overtaken them, wherewith they will provoke their God to anger, whenever they do wickedness. Since their food failed them, and all their water was scant, they took counsel to kill their livestock, and determined to consume all those things which God charged them by his laws that they should not eat. They are resolved to spend the first fruits of the grain and the tithes of the wine and the oil, which they had sanctified and reserved for the priests who stand before the face of our God in Jerusalem, which it is not fitting for any of the people so much as to touch with their hands. They have sent some to Jerusalem, because they also that dwell there have done this thing, to bring them permission from the council of elders. When these instructions come to them and they do it, they will be given to you to be destroyed the same day. Therefore I your servant, knowing all this, fled away from their presence. God sent me to work things with you, at which all the earth will be astonished, even as many as hear it. For your servant is religious, and serves the God of heaven day and night. Now, my lord, I will stay with you; and your servant will go out by night into the valley. I will pray to God, and he will tell me when they have committed their sins. Then I will come and tell you. Then you can go out with all your army, and there will be none of them that will resist you. And I will lead you through the midst of Judea, until you come to Jerusalem. I will set your throne in the midst of it. You will drive them as sheep that have no shepherd, and a dog will not so much as open his mouth before you; for these things were told me according to my foreknowledge, and were declared to me, and I was sent to tell you.”

Her words were pleasing in the sight of Holofernes and of all his servants. They marveled at her wisdom, and said, “There is not such a woman from one end of the earth to the other, for beauty of face and wisdom of words.”

Holofernes said to her, “God did well to send you before the people, that might would be in our hands, and destruction among those who slighted my lord. And now you are beautiful in your countenance, and wise in your words. If you will do as you have spoken, your God will be my God, and you will dwell in the palace of King Nebuchadnezzar, and will be renowned through the whole earth.”

### Chapter 12

He commanded that she should be brought in where his silver vessels were set, and asked that his servants should prepare some of his own delicacies for her, and that she should drink from his own wine.

And Judith said, “I can’t eat of it, lest there be an occasion of stumbling; but provision will be made for me from the things that have come with me.”

And Holofernes said to her, “But if the things that are with you should run out, from where will we be able to give you more like it? For there is none of your race with us.”

And Judith said to him, “As your soul lives, my lord, your servant will not use up those things that are with me until the Lord works by my hand the things that he has determined.” Then Holofernes’ servants brought her into the tent, and she slept until midnight. Then she rose up toward the morning watch, and sent to Holofernes, saying, “Let my lord now command that they allow your servant to go out to pray.”

Holofernes commanded his guards that they should not stop her. She stayed in the camp three days, and went out every night into the valley of Bethulia and washed herself at the fountain of water in the camp. And when she came up, she implored the Lord God of Israel to direct her way to the triumph of the children of his people. She came in clean and remained in the tent until she ate her food toward evening.

It came to pass on the fourth day, that Holofernes made a feast for his own servants only, and called none of the officers to the banquet. And he said to Bagoas the eunuch, who had charge over all that he had, “Go now, and persuade this Hebrew woman who is with you that she come to us, and eat and drink with us. For behold, it would be a disgrace if we shall let such a woman go, not having had her company; for if we don’t draw her to ourselves, she will laugh us to scorn.”

Bagoas went from the presence of Holofernes, and came in to her, and said, “Let this fair lady not fear to come to my lord, and to be honored in his presence, and to drink wine and be merry with us, and to be made this day as one of the daughters of the children of Asshur who serve in Nebuchadnezzar’s palace.”

Judith said to him, “Who am I, that I should contradict my lord? For whatever would be pleasing in his eyes, I will do speedily, and this will be my joy to the day of my death.” She arose, and decked herself with her apparel and all her woman’s attire; and her servant went and laid fleeces on the ground for her next to Holofernes, which she had received from Bagoas for her daily use, that she might sit and eat upon them.

Judith came in and sat down, and Holofernes’ heart was ravished with her. His passion was aroused, and he exceedingly desired her company. He was watching for a time to deceive her from the day that he had seen her. Holofernes said to her, “Drink now, and be merry with us.”

Judith said, “I will drink now, my lord, because my life is magnified in me this day more than all the days since I was born.” Then she took and ate and drank before him what her servant had prepared. Holofernes took great delight in her, and drank exceedingly much wine, more than he had drunk at any time in one day since he was born.

### Chapter 13

But when the evening had come, his servants hurried to depart. Bagoas shut the tent outside, and dismissed those who waited from the presence of his lord. They went away to their beds; for they were all weary, because the feast had been long. But Judith was left alone in the tent, with Holofernes lying along upon his bed; for he was drunk with wine. Judith had said to her servant that she should stand outside her bedchamber, and wait for her to come out, as she did daily; for she said she would go out to her prayer. She spoke to Bagoas according to the same words. All went away from her presence, and none was left in the bedchamber, small or great. Judith, standing by his bed, said in her heart, O Lord God of all power, look in this hour upon the works of my hands for the exaltation of Jerusalem. For now is the time to help your inheritance, and to do the thing that I have purposed to the destruction of the enemies which have risen up against us. She came to the bedpost which was at Holofernes’ head, and took down his sword from there. She drew near to the bed, took hold of the hair of his head, and said, “Strengthen me, O Lord God of Israel, this day.” She struck twice upon his neck with all her might and cut off his head, tumbled his body down from the bed, and took down the canopy from the posts. After a little while she went out, and gave Holofernes’ head to her maid; and she put it in her bag of food. They both went out together to prayer, according to their custom. They passed through the camp, circled around that valley, and went up to the mountain of Bethulia, and came to its gates.

Judith said afar off to the watchmen at the gates, “Open, open the gate, now. God is with us, even our God, to show his power yet in Israel, and his might against the enemy, as he has done even this day.”

It came to pass, when the men of her city heard her voice, they made haste to go down to the gate of their city, and they called together the elders of the city. They all ran together, both small and great, for it seemed unbelievable to them that she had come. They opened the gate and received them, making a fire to give light, and surrounded them. She said to them with a loud voice, “Praise God! Praise him! Praise God, who has not taken away his mercy from the house of Israel, but has destroyed our enemies by my hand tonight!”

Then she took the head out of the bag and showed it, and said to them, “Behold, the head of Holofernes, the chief captain of the army of Asshur, and behold, the canopy under which he laid in his drunkenness. The Lord struck him by the hand of a woman. And as the Lord lives, who preserved me in my way that I went, my countenance deceived him to his destruction, and he didn’t commit sin with me, to defile and shame me.”

All the people were exceedingly amazed, and bowed themselves, and worshiped God, and said with one accord, “Blessed are you, O our God, who have this day humiliated the enemies of your people.”

Ozias said to her, “Blessed are you, daughter, in the sight of the Most High God, above all the women upon the earth; and blessed is the Lord God, who created the heavens and the earth, who directed you to cut off the head of the prince of our enemies. For your hope will not depart from the heart of men that remember the strength of God forever. May God turn these things to you for a perpetual praise, to visit you with good things, because you didn’t spare your life by reason of the affliction of our race, but prevented our ruin, walking a straight way before our God.”

And all the people said, “Amen! Amen!”

### Chapter 14

Judith said to them, “Hear me now, my kindred, and take this head, and hang it upon the battlement of your wall. It will be, so soon as the morning appears, and the sun comes up on the earth, you shall each take up his weapons of war, and every valiant man of you go out of the city. You shall set a captain over them, as though you would go down to the plain toward the watch of the children of Asshur; but you men shall not go down. These will take up their full armor, and shall go into their camp and rouse up the captains of the army of Asshur. They will run together to Holofernes’ tent. They won’t find him. Fear will fall upon them, and they will flee before your face. You men, and all that inhabit every border of Israel, shall pursue them and overthrow them as they go. But before you do these things, summon Achior the Ammonite to me, that he may see and know him that despised the house of Israel, and that sent him to us, as it were to death.

And they called Achior out of the house of Ozias; but when he came, and saw the head of Holofernes in a man’s hand in the assembly of the people, he fell upon his face, and his spirit failed. But when they had recovered him, he fell at Judith’s feet, bowed down to her, and said, “Blessed are you in every tent of Judah! In every nation, those who hear your name will be troubled. Now tell me all the things that you have done in these days.”

And Judith declared to him in the midst of the people all the things that she had done, from the day that she went out until the time that she spoke to them. But when she finished speaking, the people shouted with a loud voice, and made a joyful noise in their city. But when Achior saw all the things that the God of Israel had done, he believed in God exceedingly, and circumcised the flesh of his foreskin, and was joined to the house of Israel, to this day.

But as soon as the morning arose, they hanged the head of Holofernes upon the wall, and every man took up his weapons, and they went forth by bands to the ascents of the mountain. But when the children of Asshur saw them, they sent word to their leaders, and they went to their captains and tribunes, and to every one of their rulers. They came to Holofernes’ tent, and said to him that was over all that he had, “Wake our lord up, now, for the slaves have been bold to come down against us to battle, that they may be utterly destroyed.”

Bagoas went in, and knocked at the outer door of the tent; for he supposed that Holofernes was sleeping with Judith. But when no one answered, he opened it, went into the bedchamber, and found him cast upon the threshold dead; and his head had been taken from him. He cried with a loud voice, with weeping, groaning, and shouting, and tore his garments. He entered into the tent where Judith lodged, and he didn’t find her. He leaped out to the people, and cried aloud, “The slaves have dealt treacherously! One woman of the Hebrews has brought shame upon the house of King Nebuchadnezzar; for, behold, Holofernes lies upon the ground, and his head is not on him!”

But when the rulers of the army of Asshur heard this, they tore their tunics, and their souls were troubled exceedingly. There were cries and an exceedingly great noise in the midst of the camp.

### Chapter 15

When those who were in the tents heard, they were amazed at what happened. Trembling and fear fell upon them, and no man dared stay any more in the sight of his neighbor, but rushing out with one accord, they fled into every way of the plain and of the hill country. Those who had encamped in the hill country round about Bethulia fled away. And then the children of Israel, every one who was a warrior among them, rushed out upon them. Ozias sent to Betomasthaim, Bebai, Chobai, and Chola, and to every border of Israel, to tell about the things that had been accomplished, and that all should rush upon their enemies to destroy them. But when the children of Israel heard this, they all fell upon them with one accord, and struck them to Chobai. Yes, and in like manner also, people from Jerusalem and from all the hill country came (for men had told them about what happened in their enemies’ camp), and those who were in Gilead and in Galilee fell upon their flank with a great slaughter, until they were past Damascus and its borders. The rest of the people who lived at Bethulia fell upon the camp of Asshur, and plundered them, and were enriched exceedingly. The children of Israel returned from the slaughter, and got possession of that which remained. The villages and the cities that were in the hill country and in the plain country took many spoils; for there was an exceedingly great supply.

Joakim the high priest, and the elders of the children of Israel who lived in Jerusalem, came to see the good things which the Lord had showed to Israel, and to see Judith and to greet her. When they came to her, they all blessed her with one accord, and said to her, “You are the exaltation of Jerusalem! You are the great glory of Israel! You are the great rejoicing of our race! You have done all these things by your hand. You have done with Israel the things that are good, and God is pleased with it. May you be blessed by the Almighty Lord forever!”

And all the people said, “Amen!”

And the people plundered the camp for thirty days; and they gave Holofernes’ tent to Judith, along with all his silver cups, his beds, his bowls, and all his furniture. She took them, placed them on her mule, prepared her wagons, and piled them on it.

And all the women of Israel ran together to see her; and they blessed her, and made a dance among them for her. She took branches in her hand, and distributed them to the women who were with her. Then they made themselves garlands of olive, she and those who were with her, and she went before all the people in the dance, leading all the women. All the men of Israel followed in their armor with garlands, and with songs in their mouths.

### Chapter 16

And Judith began to sing this song of thanksgiving in all Israel, and all the people sang with loud voices this song of praise. Judith said,

“Begin a song to my God with timbrels.

Sing to my Lord with cymbals.

Make melody to him with psalm and praise.

Exalt him, and call upon his name.

For the Lord is the God that crushes battles.

For in his armies in the midst of the people,

he delivered me out of the hand of those who persecuted me.

Asshur came out of the mountains from the north.

He came with ten thousands of his army.

Its multitude stopped the torrents.

Their horsemen covered the hills.

He said that he would burn up my borders,

kill my young men with the sword,

throw my nursing children to the ground,

give my infants up as prey,

and make my virgins a plunder.

“The Almighty Lord brought them to nothing by the hand of a woman.

For their mighty one didn’t fall by young men,

neither did sons of the Titans strike him.

Tall giants didn’t attack him,

but Judith the daughter of Merari made him weak with the beauty of her countenance.

“For she put off the apparel of her widowhood

for the exaltation of those who were distressed in Israel.

She anointed her face with ointment,

bound her hair in a tiara,

and took a linen garment to deceive him.

Her sandal ravished his eye.

Her beauty took his soul prisoner.

The sword passed through his neck.

“The Persians quaked at her daring.

The Medes were daunted at her boldness.

“Then my lowly ones shouted aloud.

My oppressed people were terrified and trembled for fear.

They lifted up their voices and the enemy fled.

The children of slave-girls pierced them through,

and wounded them as fugitives’ children.

They perished by the army of my Lord.

“I will sing to my God a new song:

O Lord, you are great and glorious,

marvelous in strength, invincible.

Let all your creation serve you;

for you spoke, and they were made.

You sent out your spirit, and it built them.

There is no one who can resist your voice.

For the mountains will be moved from their foundations with the waters,

and the rocks will melt as wax at your presence:

But you are yet merciful to those who fear you.

For all sacrifice is little for a sweet savor,

and all the fat is very little for a whole burnt offering to you;

but he who fears the Lord is great continually.

“Woe to the nations who rise up against my race!

The Lord Almighty will take vengeance on them in the day of judgment

and put fire and worms in their flesh;

and they will weep and feel their pain forever.”

Now when they came to Jerusalem, they worshiped God. When the people were purified, they offered their whole burnt offerings, their free will offerings, and their gifts. Judith dedicated all Holofernes’ stuff, which the people had given her, and gave the canopy, which she had taken for herself out of his bedchamber, for a gift to the Lord.

And the people continued feasting in Jerusalem before the sanctuary for three months, and Judith remained with them.

After these days, everyone departed to his own inheritance. Judith went away to Bethulia, and remained in her own possession, and was honorable in her time in all the land. Many desired her, but no man knew her all the days of her life from the day that Manasses her husband died and was gathered to his people. She increased in greatness exceedingly; and she grew old in her husband’s house, to one hundred five years. She let her maid go free. Then she died in Bethulia. They buried her in the cave of her husband Manasses. The house of Israel mourned for her seven days. She distributed her goods before she died to all those who were nearest of kin to Manasses her husband, and to those who were nearest of her own kindred. There was no one who made the children of Israel afraid any more in the days of Judith, nor for a long time after her death.

## Esther (Greek)

Esther, translated from the Greek Septuagint

### Introduction

The book of Esther in the Greek Septuagint contains 5 additions that the traditional Hebrew text doesn’t have. These additions are recognized as Deuterocanonical Scripture by the Roman Catholic, Greek Orthodox, and Russian Orthodox Churches. Those additions are enclosed in [square brackets]. Because the additions by themselves make little sense without the broader context of the book, we present here a translation of the whole book of Esther from the Greek.

We have chosen not to distract the reader with confusing out-of-order chapter numbers that would result from using the KJV versification, but rather merge these 5 additions as extensions at the beginning of 1:1 and after 3:13, 4:17, 8:12, and 10:3. This makes some verses (1:1, 5:1, and 8:12) really long, but it also makes the verses line up with the same verse numbers in Esther as translated from the traditional Hebrew text. Some of the proper names in this book have been changed to the more familiar Hebrew form instead of the direct transliteration from the Greek.

### Chapter 1

[In the second year of the reign of Ahasuerus the great king, on the first day of Nisan, Mordecai the son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Jew dwelling in the city Susa, a great man, serving in the king’s palace, saw a vision. Now he was one of the captives whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had carried captive from Jerusalem with Jeconiah the king of Judea. This was his dream: Behold, voices and a noise, thunders and earthquake, tumult upon the earth. And, behold, two great serpents came out, both ready for conflict. A great voice came from them. Every nation was prepared for battle by their voice, even to fight against the nation of the just. Behold, a day of darkness and blackness, suffering and anguish, affection and tumult upon the earth. And all the righteous nation was troubled, fearing their own afflictions. They prepared to die, and cried to God. Something like a great river from a little spring with much water, came from their cry. Light and the sun arose, and the lowly were exalted, and devoured the honorable.

Mordecai, who had seen this vision and what God desired to do, having arisen, kept it in his heart, and desired by all means to interpret it, even until night.

Mordecai rested quietly in the palace with Gabatha and Tharrha the king’s two chamberlains, eunuchs who guarded the palace. He heard their conversation and searched out their plans. He learned that they were preparing to lay hands on King Ahasuerus; and he informed the king concerning them. The king examined the two chamberlains. They confessed, and were led away and executed. The king wrote these things for a record. Mordecai also wrote concerning these matters. The king commanded Mordecai to serve in the palace, and gave gifts for this service. But Haman the son of Hammedatha the Bougean was honored in the sight of the king, and he endeavored to harm Mordecai and his people, because of the king’s two chamberlains.]

And it came to pass after these things in the days of Ahasuerus, —(this Ahasuerus ruled over one hundred twenty-seven provinces from India)— in those days, when King Ahasuerus was on the throne in the city of Susa, in the third year of his reign, he made a feast for his friends, for people from the rest of the nations, for the nobles of the Persians and Medes, and for the chief of the local governors. After this—after he had shown them the wealth of his kingdom and the abundant glory of his wealth during one hundred eighty days— when the days of the wedding feast were completed, the king made a banquet lasting six days for the people of the nations who were present in the city, in the court of the king’s house, which was adorned with fine linen and flax on cords of fine linen and purple, fastened to golden and silver studs on pillars of white marble and stone. There were golden and silver couches on a pavement of emerald stone, and of mother-of-pearl, and of white marble, with transparent coverings variously flowered, having roses arranged around it. There were gold and silver cups, and a small cup of carbuncle set out, of the value of thirty thousand talents, with abundant and sweet wine, which the king himself drank. This banquet was not according to the appointed law, but as the king desired to have it. He charged the stewards to perform his will and that of the company.

Also Vashti the queen made a banquet for the women in the palace where King Ahasuerus lived. Now on the seventh day, the king, being merry, told Haman, Bazan, Tharrha, Baraze, Zatholtha, Abataza, and Tharaba, the seven chamberlains, servants of King Ahasuerus, to bring in the queen to him, to enthrone her, and crown her with the diadem, and to show her to the princes, and her beauty to the nations, for she was beautiful. But queen Vashti refused to come with the chamberlains; so the king was grieved and angered. And he said to his friends, “This is what Vashti said. Therefore pronounce your legal judgment on this case.”

So Arkesaeus, Sarsathaeus, and Malisear, the princes of the Persians and Medes, who were near the king, who sat chief in rank by the king, drew near to him, and reported to him according to the laws what it was proper to do to queen Vashti, because she had not done the things commanded by the king through the chamberlains. And Memucan said to the king and to the princes, “Queen Vashti has not wronged the king only, but also all the king’s rulers and princes; for he has told them the words of the queen, and how she disobeyed the king. As she then refused to obey King Ahasuerus, so this day the other wives of the chiefs of the Persians and Medes, having heard what she said to the king, will dare in the same way to dishonor their husbands. If then it seems good to the king, let him make a royal decree, and let it be written according to the laws of the Medes and Persians, and let him not alter it: ‘Don’t allow the queen to come in to him any more. Let the king give her royalty to a woman better than she.’ Let the law of the king which he will have made be widely proclaimed in his kingdom. Then all the women will give honor to their husbands, from the poor even to the rich.” This advice pleased the king and the princes; and the king did as Memucan had said, and sent into all his kingdom through the several provinces, according to their language, so that men might be feared in their own houses.

### Chapter 2

After this, the king’s anger was pacified, and he no more mentioned Vashti, bearing in mind what she had said, and how he had condemned her. Then the servants of the king said, “Let chaste, beautiful young virgins be sought for the king. Let the king appoint local governors in all the provinces of his kingdom, and let them select beautiful, chaste young ladies and bring them to the city Susa, into the women’s apartment. Let them be consigned to the king’s chamberlain, the keeper of the women. Then let things for purification and other needs be given to them. Let the woman who pleases the king be queen instead of Vashti.”

This thing pleased the king; and he did so.

Now there was a Jew in the city Susa, and his name was Mordecai, the son of Jairus, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish, of the tribe of Benjamin. He had been brought as a prisoner from Jerusalem, whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had carried into captivity. He had a foster child, daughter of Aminadab his father’s brother. Her name was Esther. When her parents died, he brought her up to womanhood as his own. This lady was beautiful. And because the king’s ordinance was published, many ladies were gathered to the city of Susa under the hand of Hegai; and Esther was brought to Hegai, the keeper of the women. The lady pleased him, and she found favor in his sight. He hurried to give her the things for purification, her portion, and the seven maidens appointed her out of the palace. He treated her and her maidens well in the women’s apartment. But Esther didn’t reveal her family or her kindred, for Mordecai had charged her not to tell. But Mordecai used to walk every day by the women’s court, to see what would become of Esther.

Now this was the time for a virgin to go into the king, when she had completed twelve months; for so are the days of purification fulfilled, six months while they are anointing themselves with oil of myrrh, and six months with spices and women’s purifications. And then the lady goes in to the king. The officer that he commands to do so will bring her to come in with him from the women’s apartment to the king’s chamber. She enters in the evening, and in the morning she departs to the second women’s apartment, where Hegai the king’s chamberlain is keeper of the women. She doesn’t go in to the king again, unless she is called by name. And when the time was fulfilled for Esther the daughter of Aminadab the brother of Mordecai’s father to go in to the king, she neglected nothing which the chamberlain, the women’s keeper, commanded; for Esther found grace in the sight of all who looked at her. So Esther went in to King Ahasuerus in the twelfth month, which is Adar, in the seventh year of his reign. The king loved Esther, and she found favor beyond all the other virgins. He put the queen’s crown on her. The king made a banquet for all his friends and great men for seven days, and he highly celebrated the marriage of Esther; and he granted a remission of taxes to those who were under his dominion.

Meanwhile, Mordecai served in the courtyard. Now Esther had not revealed her country, for so Mordecai commanded her, to fear God, and perform his commandments, as when she was with him. Esther didn’t change her manner of life.

Two chamberlains of the king, the chiefs of the body-guard, were grieved, because Mordecai was promoted; and they sought to kill King Ahasuerus. And the matter was discovered by Mordecai, and he made it known to Esther, and she declared to the king the matter of the conspiracy. And the king examined the two chamberlains and hanged them. Then the king gave orders to make a note for a memorial in the royal library of the goodwill shown by Mordecai, as a commendation.

### Chapter 3

After this, King Ahasuerus highly honored Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Bugaean. He exalted him and set his seat above all his friends. All in the palace bowed down to him, for so the king had given orders to do; but Mordecai didn’t bow down to him. And they in the king’s palace said to Mordecai, “Mordecai, why do you transgress the commands of the king?” They questioned him daily, but he didn’t listen to them; so they reported to Haman that Mordecai resisted the commands of the king; and Mordecai had shown to them that he was a Jew. When Haman understood that Mordecai didn’t bow down to him, he was greatly enraged, and plotted to utterly destroy all the Jews who were under the rule of Ahasuerus.

In the twelfth year of the reign of Ahasuerus, Haman made a decision by casting lots by day and month, to kill the race of Mordecai in one day. The lot fell on the fourteenth day of the month of Adar. So he spoke to King Ahasuerus, saying, “There is a nation scattered among the nations in all your kingdom, and their laws differ from all the other nations. They disobey the king’s laws. It is not expedient for the king to tolerate them. If it seem good to the king, let him make a decree to destroy them, and I will remit into the king’s treasury ten thousand talents of silver.”

So the king took off his ring, and gave it into the hands of Haman to seal the decrees against the Jews. The king said to Haman, “Keep the silver, and treat the nation as you will.” So the king’s recorders were called in the first month, on the thirteenth day, and they wrote as Haman commanded to the captains and governors in every province, from India even to Ethiopia, to one hundred twenty-seven provinces; and to the rulers of the nations according to their languages, in the name of King Ahasuerus. The message was sent by couriers throughout the kingdom of Ahasuerus, to utterly destroy the race of the Jews on the first day of the twelfth month, which is Adar, and to plunder their goods. [The following is the copy of the letter. “From the great King Ahasuerus to the rulers and the governors under them of one hundred twenty-seven provinces, from India even to Ethiopia, who hold authority under him:

“Ruling over many nations and having obtained dominion over the whole world, I was determined (not elated by the confidence of power, but ever conducting myself with great moderation and gentleness) to make the lives of my subjects continually tranquil, desiring both to maintain the kingdom quiet and orderly to its utmost limits, and to restore the peace desired by all men. When I had asked my counselors how this should be brought to pass, Haman, who excels in soundness of judgment among us, and has been manifestly well inclined without wavering and with unshaken fidelity, and had obtained the second post in the kingdom, informed us that a certain ill-disposed people is scattered among all the tribes throughout the world, opposed in their law to every other nation, and continually neglecting the commands of the king, so that the united government blamelessly administered by us is not quietly established. Having then conceived that this nation is continually set in opposition to every man, introducing as a change a foreign code of laws, and injuriously plotting to accomplish the worst of evils against our interests, and against the happy establishment of the monarchy, we instruct you in the letter written by Haman, who is set over the public affairs and is our second governor, to destroy them all utterly with their wives and children by the swords of the enemies, without pitying or sparing any, on the fourteenth day of the twelfth month Adar, of the present year; that the people aforetime and now ill-disposed to us having been violently consigned to death in one day, may hereafter secure to us continually a well constituted and quiet state of affairs.”] Copies of the letters were published in every province; and an order was given to all the nations to be ready for that day. This business was hastened also in Susa. The king and Haman began to drink, but the city was confused.

### Chapter 4

But Mordecai, having perceived what was done, tore his garments, put on sackcloth, and sprinkled dust upon himself. Having rushed forth through the open street of the city, he cried with a loud voice, “A nation that has done no wrong is going to be destroyed!” He came to the king’s gate, and stood; for it was not lawful for him to enter into the palace wearing sackcloth and ashes. And in every province where the letters were published, there was crying, lamentation, and great mourning on the part of the Jews. They wore sackcloth and ashes. The queen’s maids and chamberlains went in and told her; and when she had heard what was done, she was deeply troubled. She sent clothes to Mordecai to replace his sackcloth, but he refused. So Esther called for her chamberlain Hathach, who waited upon her; and she sent to learn the truth from Mordecai. Mordecai showed him what was done, and the promise which Haman had made the king of ten thousand talents to be paid into the treasury, that he might destroy the Jews. And he gave him the copy of what was published in Susa concerning their destruction to show to Esther; and told him to charge her to go in and entreat the king, and to beg him for the people. “Remember, he said, the days of your humble condition, how you were nursed by my hand; because Haman, who holds the next place to the king, has spoken against us to cause our death. Call upon the Lord, and speak to the king concerning us, to deliver us from death.”

So Hathach went in and told her all these words. Esther said to Hathach, “Go to Mordecai, and say, ‘All the nations of the empire know than any man or woman who goes in to the king into the inner court without being called, that person must die, unless the king stretches out his golden sceptre; then he shall live. I haven’t been called to go into the king for thirty days.’”

So Hathach reported to Mordecai all the words of Esther. Then Mordecai said to Hathach, “Go, and say to her, ‘Esther, don’t say to yourself that you alone will escape in the kingdom, more than all the other Jews. For if you keep quiet on this occasion, help and protection will come to the Jews from another place; but you and your father’s house will perish. Who knows if you have been made queen for this occasion?’”

And Esther sent the messenger who came to her to Mordecai, saying, “Go and assemble the Jews that are in Susa, and all of you fast for me. Don’t eat or drink for three days, night and day. My maidens and I will also fast. Then I will go in to the king contrary to the law, even if I must die.”

So Mordecai went and did all that Esther commanded him. [He prayed to the Lord, making mention of all the works of the Lord. He said, “Lord God, you are king ruling over all, for all things are in your power, and there is no one who can oppose you in your purpose to save Israel; for you have made the heaven and the earth and every wonderful thing under heaven. You are Lord of all, and there is no one who can resist you, Lord. You know all things. You know, Lord, that it is not in insolence, nor arrogance, nor love of glory, that I have done this, to refuse to bow down to the arrogant Haman. For I would gladly have kissed the soles of his feet for the safety of Israel. But I have done this that I might not set the glory of man above the glory of God. I will not worship anyone except you, my Lord, and I will not do these things in arrogance. And now, O Lord God, the King, the God of Abraham, spare your people, for our enemies are planning our destruction, and they have desired to destroy your ancient inheritance. Do not overlook your people, whom you have redeemed for yourself out of the land of Egypt. Listen to my prayer. Have mercy on your inheritance and turn our mourning into gladness, that we may live and sing praise to your name, O Lord. Don’t utterly destroy the mouth of those who praise you, O Lord.”

All Israel cried with all their might, for death was before their eyes. And queen Esther took refuge in the Lord, being taken as it were in the agony of death. Having taken off her glorious apparel, she put on garments of distress and mourning. Instead of grand perfumes she filled her head with ashes and dung. She greatly humbled her body, and she filled every place of her glad adorning with her tangled hair. She implored the Lord God of Israel, and said, “O my Lord, you alone are our king. Help me. I am destitute, and have no helper but you, for my danger is near at hand. I have heard from my birth in the tribe of my kindred that you, Lord, took Israel out of all the nations, and our fathers out of all their kindred for a perpetual inheritance, and have done for them all that you have said. And now we have sinned before you, and you have delivered us into the hands of our enemies, because we honored their gods. You are righteous, O Lord. But now they have not been content with the bitterness of our slavery, but have laid their hands on the hands of their idols to abolish the decree of your mouth, and utterly to destroy your inheritance, and to stop the mouth of those who praise you, and to extinguish the glory of your house and your altar, and to open the mouth of the Gentiles to speak the praises of vanities, and that a mortal king should be admired forever. O Lord, don’t surrender your sceptre to those who don’t exist, and don’t let them laugh at our fall, but turn their counsel against themselves, and make an example of him who has begun to injure us. Remember us, O Lord! Manifest yourself in the time of our affliction. Encourage me, O King of gods, and ruler of all dominion! Put harmonious speech into my mouth before the lion, and turn his heart to hate him who fights against us, to the utter destruction of those who agree with him. But deliver us by your hand, and help me who am alone and have no one but you, O Lord. You know all things, and know that I hate the glory of transgressors, and that I abhor the bed of the uncircumcised and of every stranger. You know my necessity, for I abhor the symbol of my proud station, which is upon my head in the days of my splendor. I abhor it as a menstruous cloth, and I don’t wear it in the days of my tranquility. Your handmaid has not eaten at Haman’s table, and I have not honored the banquet of the king, neither have I drunk wine of libations. Neither has your handmaid rejoiced since the day of my promotion until now, except in you, O Lord God of Abraham. O god, who has power over all, listen to the voice of the desperate, and deliver us from the hand of those who devise mischief. Deliver me from my fear.]

### Chapter 5

It came to pass on the third day, when she had ceased praying, that she took off her servant’s dress and put on her glorious apparel. Being splendidly dressed and having called upon God the Overseer and Preserver of all things, she took her two maids, and she leaned upon one, as a delicate female, and the other followed bearing her train. She was blooming in the perfection of her beauty. Her face was cheerful and looked lovely, but her heart was filled with fear. Having passed through all the doors, she stood before the king. He was sitting on his royal throne. He had put on all his glorious apparel, covered all over with gold and precious stones, and was very terrifying. And having raised his face resplendent with glory, he looked with intense anger. The queen fell, and changed her color as she fainted. She bowed herself upon the head of the maid who went before her. But God changed the spirit of the king to gentleness, and in intense feeling, he sprang from off his throne, and took her into his arms, until she recovered. He comforted her with peaceful words, and said to her, “What is the matter, Esther? I am your relative. Cheer up! You shall not die, for our command is openly declared to you: ‘Draw near.’”

And having raised the golden sceptre, he laid it upon her neck, and embraced her. He said, “Speak to me.”

So she said to him, “I saw you, my lord, as an angel of God, and my heart was troubled for fear of your glory; for you, my lord, are to be wondered at, and your face is full of grace.” While she was speaking, she fainted and fell.

Then the king was troubled, and all his servants comforted her. The king said, “What do you desire, Esther? What is your request? Ask even to the half of my kingdom, and it shall be yours.”

Esther said, “Today is a special day. So if it seems good to the king, let both him and Haman come to the feast which I will prepare this day.”

The king said, “Hurry and bring Haman here, that we may do as Esther said.” So they both came to the feast about which Esther had spoken. At the banquet, the king said to Esther, “What is your request, queen Esther? You shall have all that you require.”

She said, “My request and my petition is: if I have found favor in the king’s sight, let the king and Haman come again tomorrow to the feast which I shall prepare for them, and tomorrow I will do as I have done today.”

So Haman went out from the king very glad and merry; but when Haman saw Mordecai the Jew in the court, he was greatly enraged. Having gone into his own house, he called his friends, and his wife Zeresh. He showed them his wealth and the glory with which the king had invested him, and how he had promoted him to be chief ruler in the kingdom. Haman said, “The queen has called no one to the feast with the king but me, and I am invited tomorrow. But these things don’t please me while I see Mordecai the Jew in the court.

Then Zeresh his wife and his friends said to him, “Let a fifty cubit tall gallows be made for you. In the morning you speak to the king, and let Mordecai be hanged on the gallows; but you go in to the feast with the king, and be merry.”

The saying pleased Haman, and the gallows was prepared.

### Chapter 6

The Lord removed sleep from the king that night; so he told his servant to bring in the books, the registers of daily events, to read to him. And he found the records written concerning Mordecai, how he had told the king about the king’s two chamberlains, when they were keeping guard, and sought to lay hands on Ahasuerus. The king said, “What honor or favor have we done for Mordecai?”

The king’s servants said, “You haven’t done anything for him.”

And while the king was enquiring about the kindness of Mordecai, behold, Haman was in the court. The king said, “Who is in the court? Now Haman had come in to speak to the king about hanging Mordecai on the gallows which he had prepared. The king’s servants said, “Behold, Haman stands in the court.”

And the king said, “Call him!”

The king said to Haman, “What should I do for the man whom I wish to honor?”

Haman said within himself, “Whom would the king honor but myself?” He said to the king, “As for the man whom the king wishes to honor, let the king’s servants bring the robe of fine linen which the king puts on, and the horse on which the king rides, and let him give it to one of the king’s noble friends, and let him dress the man whom the king loves. Let him mount him on the horse, and proclaim through the streets of the city, saying, “This is what will be done for every man whom the king honors!”

Then the king said to Haman, “You have spoken well. Do so for Mordecai the Jew, who waits in the palace, and let not a word of what you have spoken be neglected!”

So Haman took the robe and the horse, dressed Mordecai, mounted him on the horse, and went through the streets of the city, proclaiming, “This is what will be done for every man whom the king wishes to honor.” Then Mordecai returned to the palace; but Haman went home mourning, with his head covered.

Haman related the events that had happened to him to Zeresh his wife and to his friends. His friends and his wife said to him, “If Mordecai is of the race of the Jews, and you have begun to be humbled before him, you will assuredly fall; and you will not be able to withstand him, for the living God is with him.” While they were still speaking, the chamberlains arrived to rush Haman to the banquet which Esther had prepared.

### Chapter 7

So the king and Haman went in to drink with the queen. The king said to Esther at the banquet on the second day, “What is it, queen Esther? What is your request? What is your petition? It shall be done for you, up to half of my kingdom.”

She answered and said, “If I have found favor in the sight of the king, let my life be granted as my petition, and my people as my request. For both I and my people are sold for destruction, pillage, and genocide. If both we and our children were sold for male and female slaves, I would not have bothered you, for this isn’t worthy of the king’s palace.”

The king said, “Who has dared to do this thing?”

Esther said, “The enemy is Haman, this wicked man!”

Then Haman was terrified in the presence of the king and the queen. The king rose up from the banquet to go into the garden. Haman began to beg the queen for mercy, for he saw that he was in serious trouble. The king returned from the garden; and Haman had fallen upon the couch, begging the queen for mercy. The king said, “Will you even assault my wife in my house?”

And when Haman heard it, he changed countenance. And Bugathan, one of the chamberlains, said to the king, “Behold, Haman has also prepared a gallows for Mordecai, who spoke concerning the king, and a fifty cubit high gallows has been set up on Haman’s property.”

The king said, “Let him be hanged on it!” So Haman was hanged on the gallows that had been prepared for Mordecai. Then the king’s wrath was abated.

### Chapter 8

On that day, King Ahasuerus gave to Esther all that belonged to Haman the slanderer. The king called Mordecai, for Esther had told that he was related to her. The king took the ring which he had taken away from Haman and gave it to Mordecai. Esther appointed Mordecai over all that had been Haman’s. She spoke yet again to the king, and fell at his feet, and implored him to undo Haman’s mischief and all that he had done against the Jews. Then the king extended the golden sceptre to Esther; and Esther arose to stand near the king. Esther said, “If it seems good to you, and I have found favor in your sight, let an order be sent that the letters sent by Haman may be reversed—letters that were written for the destruction of the Jews who are in your kingdom. For how could I see the affliction of my people, and how could I survive the destruction of my kindred?”

Then the king said to Esther, “If I have given and freely granted you all that was Haman’s, and hanged him on a gallows because he laid his hands upon the Jews, what more do you seek? Write in my name whatever seems good to you, and seal it with my ring; for whatever is written at the command of the king, and sealed with my ring, cannot be countermanded. So the scribes were called in the first month, which is Nisan, on the twenty-third day of the same year; and orders were written to the Jews, whatever the king had commanded to the local governors and chiefs of the local governors, from India even to Ethiopia—one hundred twenty-seven local governors, according to the several provinces, in their own languages. They were written by order of the king, sealed with his ring, and the letters were sent by the couriers. In them, he charged them to use their own laws in every city, to help each other, and to treat their adversaries and those who attacked them as they pleased, on one day in all the kingdom of Ahasuerus, on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is Adar. Let the copies be posted in conspicuous places throughout the kingdom. Let all the Jews be ready against this day, to fight against their enemies. The following is a copy of the letter containing orders:

[The great King Ahasuerus sends greetings to the rulers of provinces in one hundred twenty-seven local governance regions, from India to Ethiopia, even to those who are faithful to our interests. Many who have been frequently honored by the most abundant kindness of their benefactors have conceived ambitious designs, and not only endeavor to hurt our subjects, but moreover, not being able to bear prosperity, they also endeavor to plot against their own benefactors. They not only would utterly abolish gratitude from among men, but also, elated by the boastings of men who are strangers to all that is good, they supposed that they would escape the sin-hating vengeance of the ever-seeing God. And oftentimes evil exhortation has made partakers of the guilt of shedding innocent blood, and has involved in irremediable calamities many of those who had been appointed to offices of authority, who had been entrusted with the management of their friends’ affairs; while men, by the false sophistry of an evil disposition, have deceived the simple goodwill of the ruling powers. And it is possible to see this, not so much from more ancient traditional accounts, as it is immediately in your power to see it by examining what things have been wickedly perpetrated by the baseness of men unworthily holding power. It is right to take heed with regard to the future, that we may maintain the government in undisturbed peace for all men, adopting needful changes, and ever judging those cases which come under our notice with truly equitable decisions. For whereas Haman, a Macedonian, the son of Hammedatha, in reality an alien from the blood of the Persians, and differing widely from our mild course of government, having been hospitably entertained by us, obtained so large a share of our universal kindness as to be called our father, and to continue the person next to the royal throne, reverenced of all; he however, overcome by pride, endeavored to deprive us of our dominion, and our life; having by various and subtle artifices demanded for destruction both Mordecai our deliverer and perpetual benefactor, and Esther the blameless consort of our kingdom, along with their whole nation. For by these methods he thought, having surprised us in a defenseless state, to transfer the dominion of the Persians to the Macedonians. But we find that the Jews, who have been consigned to destruction by the most abominable of men, are not malefactors, but living according to the most just laws, and being the sons of the living God, the most high and mighty, who maintains the kingdom, to us as well as to our forefathers, in the most excellent order. You will therefore do well in refusing to obey the letter sent by Haman the son of Hammedatha, because he who has done these things has been hanged with his whole family at the gates of Susa, Almighty God having swiftly returned to him a worthy punishment. We enjoin you then, having openly published a copy of this letter in every place, to give the Jews permission to use their own lawful customs and to strengthen them, that on the thirteenth of the twelfth month Adar, on the self-same day, they may defend themselves against those who attack them in a time of affliction. For in the place of the destruction of the chosen race, Almighty God has granted them this time of gladness. Therefore you also, among your notable feasts, must keep a distinct day with all festivity, that both now and hereafter it may be a day of deliverance to us and who are well disposed toward the Persians, but to those that plotted against us a memorial of destruction. And every city and province collectively, which shall not do accordingly, shall be consumed with vengeance by spear and fire. It shall be made not only inaccessible to men, but most hateful to wild beasts and birds forever.] Let the copies be posted in conspicuous places throughout the kingdom and let all the Jews be ready against this day, to fight against their enemies. So the horsemen went forth with haste to perform the king’s commands. The ordinance was also published in Susa.

Mordecai went out robed in royal apparel, wearing a golden crown and a diadem of fine purple linen. The people in Susa saw it and rejoiced. The Jews had light and gladness in every city and province where the ordinance was published. Wherever the proclamation took place, the Jews had joy and gladness, feasting and mirth. Many of the Gentiles were circumcised and became Jews for fear of the Jews.

### Chapter 9

Now in the twelfth month, on the thirteenth day of the month, which is Adar, the letters written by the king arrived. In that day, the adversaries of the Jews perished; for no one resisted, through fear of them. For the chiefs of the local governors, and the princes and the royal scribes, honored the Jews; for the fear of Mordecai was upon them. For the order of the king was in force, that he should be celebrated in all the kingdom. In the city Susa the Jews killed five hundred men, including Pharsannes, Delphon, Phasga, Pharadatha, Barea, Sarbaca, Marmasima, Ruphaeus, Arsaeus, and Zabuthaeus, the ten sons of Haman the son of Hammedatha the Bugaean, the enemy of the Jews; and they plundered their property on the same day. The number of those who perished in Susa was reported to the king.

Then the king said to Esther, “The Jews have slain five hundred men in the city Susa. What do you think they have done in the rest of the country? What more do you ask, that it may be done for you?”

Esther said to the king, “Let it be granted to the Jews to do the same to them tomorrow. Also, hang the bodies of the ten sons of Haman.”

He permitted it to be done; and he gave up to the Jews of the city the bodies of the sons of Haman to hang. The Jews assembled in Susa on the fourteenth day of Adar and killed three hundred men, but plundered no property.

The rest of the Jews who were in the kingdom assembled, and helped one another, and obtained rest from their enemies; for they destroyed fifteen thousand of them on the thirteenth day of Adar, but took no spoil. They rested on the fourteenth of the same month, and kept it as a day of rest with joy and gladness.

The Jews in the city of Susa assembled also on the fourteenth day and rested; and they also observed the fifteenth with joy and gladness. On this account then, the Jews dispersed in every foreign land keep the fourteenth of Adar as a holy day with joy, each sending gifts of food to his neighbor.

Mordecai wrote these things in a book and sent them to the Jews, as many as were in the kingdom of Ahasuerus, both those who were near and those who were far away, to establish these as joyful days and to keep the fourteenth and fifteenth of Adar; for on these days the Jews obtained rest from their enemies; and in that month, which was Adar, in which a change was made for them from mourning to joy, and from sorrow to a holiday, to spend the whole of it in good days of feasting and gladness, sending portions to their friends and to the poor. And the Jews consented to this as Mordecai wrote to them, showing how Haman the son of Hammedatha the Macedonian fought against them, how he made a decree and cast lots to destroy them utterly; also how he went in to the king, telling him to hang Mordecai; but all the calamities he tried to bring upon the Jews came upon himself, and he was hanged, along with his children. Therefore these days were called Purim, because of the lots (for in their language they are called Purim) because of the words of this letter, and because of all they suffered on this account, and all that happened to them. Mordecai established it, and the Jews took upon themselves, upon their offspring, and upon those who were joined to them to observe it, neither would they on any account behave differently; but these days were to be a memorial kept in every generation, city, family, and province. These days of Purim shall be kept forever, and their memorial shall not fail in any generation.

Queen Esther the daughter of Aminadab and Mordecai the Jew wrote all that they had done, and gave the confirmation of the letter about Purim. Mordecai and Esther the queen established this decision on their own, pledging their own well-being to their plan. And Esther established it by a command forever, and it was written for a memorial.

### Chapter 10

The king levied a tax upon his kingdom both by land and sea. As for his strength and valour, and the wealth and glory of his kingdom, behold, they are written in the book of the Persians and Medes for a memorial.

Mordecai was viceroy to King Ahasuerus, and was a great man in the kingdom, honored by the Jews, and lived his life loved by all his nation. [Mordecai said, “These things have come from God. For I remember the dream which I had concerning these matters; for not one detail of them has failed. There was the little spring which became a river, and there was light, and the sun and much water. The river is Esther, whom the king married and made queen. The two serpents are Haman and me. The nations are those which combined to destroy the name of the Jews. But as for my nation, this is Israel, even those who cried to God and were delivered; for the Lord delivered his people. The Lord rescued us out of all these calamities; and God worked such signs and great wonders as have not been done among the nations. Therefore he ordained two lots. One for the people of God, and one for all the other nations. And these two lots came for an appointed season, and for a day of judgment, before God, and for all the nations. God remembered his people and vindicated his inheritance. They shall observe these days in the month Adar, on the fourteenth and on the fifteenth day of the month, with an assembly, joy, and gladness before God, throughout the generations forever among his people Israel. In the fourth year of the reign of Ptolemeus and Cleopatra, Dositheus, who said he was a priest and Levite, and Ptolemeus his son brought this letter of Purim, which they said was authentic, and that Lysimachus the son of Ptolemeus, who was in Jerusalem, had interpreted.]

## Daniel (Greek)

The Book of Daniel, with Greek Portions

### Chapter 1

In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came to Jerusalem and besieged it. The Lord gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand, with part of the vessels of the house of God; and he carried them into the land of Shinar to the house of his god. He brought the vessels into the treasure house of his god.

The king spoke to Ashpenaz the master of his eunuchs, that he should bring in some of the children of Israel, even of the royal offspring and of the nobles— youths in whom was no defect, but well-favored, and skillful in all wisdom, and endowed with knowledge, and understanding science, and who had the ability to serve in the king’s palace; and that he should teach them the learning and the language of the Chaldeans. The king appointed for them a daily portion of the king’s delicacies, and of the wine which he drank, and that they should be nourished three years; that at its end they should serve the king.

Now among these were of the children of Judah: Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah. The prince of the eunuchs gave names to them: to Daniel he gave the name Belteshazzar; to Hananiah, Shadrach; to Mishael, Meshach; and to Azariah, Abednego.

But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the king’s delicacies, nor with the wine which he drank. Therefore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself. Now God made Daniel find kindness and compassion in the sight of the prince of the eunuchs. The prince of the eunuchs said to Daniel, “I fear my lord the king, who has appointed your food and your drink. For why should he see your faces worse looking than the youths who are of your own age? Then you would endanger my head with the king.”

Then Daniel said to the steward whom the prince of the eunuchs had appointed over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah: “Test your servants, I beg you, ten days; and let them give us vegetables to eat and water to drink. Then let our faces be examined before you, and the face of the youths who eat of the king’s delicacies; and as you see, deal with your servants.” So he listened to them in this matter, and tested them for ten days.

At the end of ten days, their faces appeared fairer, and they were fatter in flesh, than all the youths who ate of the king’s delicacies. So the steward took away their delicacies, and the wine that they would drink, and gave them vegetables.

Now as for these four youths, God gave them knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom; and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams.

At the end of the days which the king had appointed for bringing them in, the prince of the eunuchs brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar. The king talked with them; and among them all was found no one like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah. Therefore they served the king. In every matter of wisdom and understanding concerning which the king inquired of them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians and enchanters who were in all his realm.

Daniel continued serving even to the first year of King Cyrus.

### Chapter 2

In the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams; and his spirit was troubled, and his sleep went from him. Then the king commanded that the magicians, the enchanters, the sorcerers, and the Chaldeans be called to tell the king his dreams. So they came in and stood before the king. The king said to them, “I have dreamed a dream, and my spirit is troubled to know the dream.”

Then the Chaldeans spoke to the king in the Syrian language, “O king, live forever! Tell your servants the dream, and we will show the interpretation.”

The king answered the Chaldeans, “The thing has gone from me. If you don’t make known to me the dream and its interpretation, you will be cut in pieces, and your houses will be made a dunghill. But if you show the dream and its interpretation, you will receive from me gifts, rewards, and great honor. Therefore show me the dream and its interpretation.”

They answered the second time and said, “Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we will show the interpretation.”

The king answered, “I know of a certainty that you are trying to gain time, because you see the thing has gone from me. But if you don’t make known to me the dream, there is but one law for you; for you have prepared lying and corrupt words to speak before me, until the situation changes. Therefore tell me the dream, and I will know that you can show me its interpretation.”

The Chaldeans answered before the king, and said, “There is not a man on the earth who can show the king’s matter, because no king, lord, or ruler, has asked such a thing of any magician, enchanter, or Chaldean. It is a rare thing that the king requires, and there is no other who can show it before the king, except the gods, whose dwelling is not with flesh.”

Because of this, the king was angry and very furious, and commanded that all the wise men of Babylon be destroyed. So the decree went out, and the wise men were to be slain. They sought Daniel and his companions to be slain.

Then Daniel returned answer with counsel and prudence to Arioch the captain of the king’s guard, who had gone out to kill the wise men of Babylon. He answered Arioch the king’s captain, “Why is the decree so urgent from the king?” Then Arioch made the thing known to Daniel. Daniel went in, and desired of the king that he would appoint him a time, and he would show the king the interpretation.

Then Daniel went to his house and made the thing known to Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, his companions, that they would desire mercies of the God of heaven concerning this secret, and that Daniel and his companions would not perish with the rest of the wise men of Babylon. Then the secret was revealed to Daniel in a vision of the night. Then Daniel blessed the God of heaven. Daniel answered,

“Blessed be the name of God forever and ever;

for wisdom and might are his.

He changes the times and the seasons.

He removes kings and sets up kings.

He gives wisdom to the wise,

and knowledge to those who have understanding.

He reveals the deep and secret things.

He knows what is in the darkness,

and the light dwells with him.

I thank you and praise you,

O God of my fathers,

who have given me wisdom and might,

and have now made known to me what we desired of you;

for you have made known to us the king’s matter.”

Therefore Daniel went in to Arioch, whom the king had appointed to destroy the wise men of Babylon. He went and said this to him: “Don’t destroy the wise men of Babylon. Bring me in before the king, and I will show to the king the interpretation.”

Then Arioch brought in Daniel before the king in haste, and said this to him: “I have found a man of the children of the captivity of Judah who will make known to the king the interpretation.”

The king answered Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, “Are you able to make known to me the dream which I have seen, and its interpretation?”

Daniel answered before the king, and said, “The secret which the king has demanded can’t be shown to the king by wise men, enchanters, magicians, or soothsayers; but there is a God in heaven who reveals secrets, and he has made known to King Nebuchadnezzar what will be in the latter days. Your dream, and the visions of your head on your bed, are these:

“As for you, O king, your thoughts came on your bed, what should happen hereafter; and he who reveals secrets has made known to you what will happen. But as for me, this secret is not revealed to me for any wisdom that I have more than any living, but to the intent that the interpretation may be made known to the king, and that you may know the thoughts of your heart.

“You, O king, saw, and behold, a great image. This image, which was mighty, and whose brightness was excellent, stood before you; and its appearance was terrifying. As for this image, its head was of fine gold, its breast and its arms of silver, its belly and its thighs of bronze, its legs of iron, its feet part of iron, and part of clay. You saw until a stone was cut out without hands, which struck the image on its feet that were of iron and clay, and broke them in pieces. Then the iron, the clay, the bronze, the silver, and the gold were broken in pieces together, and became like the chaff of the summer threshing floors. The wind carried them away, so that no place was found for them. The stone that struck the image became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth.

“This is the dream; and we will tell its interpretation before the king. You, O king, are king of kings, to whom the God of heaven has given the kingdom, the power, the strength, and the glory. Wherever the children of men dwell, he has given the animals of the field and the birds of the sky into your hand, and has made you rule over them all. You are the head of gold.

“After you, another kingdom will arise that is inferior to you; and a third kingdom of bronze, which will rule over all the earth. The fourth kingdom will be strong as iron, because iron breaks in pieces and subdues all things; and as iron that crushes all these, it will break in pieces and crush. Whereas you saw the feet and toes, part of potters’ clay, and part of iron, it will be a divided kingdom; but there will be in it of the strength of the iron, because you saw the iron mixed with miry clay. As the toes of the feet were part of iron, and part of clay, so the kingdom will be partly strong, and partly brittle. Whereas you saw the iron mixed with miry clay, they will mingle themselves with the seed of men; but they won’t cling to one another, even as iron does not mix with clay.

“In the days of those kings the God of heaven will set up a kingdom which will never be destroyed, nor will its sovereignty be left to another people; but it will break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it will stand forever. Because you saw that a stone was cut out of the mountain without hands, and that it broke in pieces the iron, the bronze, the clay, the silver, and the gold. The great God has made known to the king what will happen hereafter. The dream is certain, and its interpretation sure.”

Then King Nebuchadnezzar fell on his face, worshiped Daniel, and commanded that they should offer an offering and sweet odors to him. The king answered to Daniel, and said, “Of a truth your God is the God of gods, and the Lord of kings, and a revealer of secrets, since you have been able to reveal this secret.”

Then the king made Daniel great, and gave him many great gifts, and made him rule over the whole province of Babylon, and to be chief governor over all the wise men of Babylon. Daniel requested of the king, and he appointed Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego over the affairs of the province of Babylon; but Daniel was in the king’s gate.

### Chapter 3

Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold, whose height was sixty cubits, and its width six cubits. He set it up in the plain of Dura, in the province of Babylon. Then Nebuchadnezzar the king sent to gather together the local governors, the deputies, and the governors, the judges, the treasurers, the counselors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces, to come to the dedication of the image which Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up. Then the local governors, the deputies, and the governors, the judges, the treasurers, the counselors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces, were gathered together to the dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up; and they stood before the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up.

Then the herald cried aloud, “To you it is commanded, peoples, nations, and languages, that whenever you hear the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp, pipe, and all kinds of music, you fall down and worship the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king has set up. Whoever doesn’t fall down and worship shall be cast into the middle of a burning fiery furnace the same hour.”

Therefore at that time, when all the peoples heard the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp, pipe, and all kinds of music, all the peoples, the nations, and the languages, fell down and worshiped the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.

Therefore at that time certain Chaldeans came near, and brought accusation against the Jews. They answered Nebuchadnezzar the king, “O king, live for ever! You, O king, have made a decree that every man who hears the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp, pipe, and all kinds of music shall fall down and worship the golden image; and whoever doesn’t fall down and worship shall be cast into the middle of a burning fiery furnace. There are certain Jews whom you have appointed over the affairs of the province of Babylon: Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. These men, O king, have not respected you. They don’t serve your gods, and don’t worship the golden image which you have set up.”

Then Nebuchadnezzar in rage and fury commanded that Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego be brought. Then these men were brought before the king. Nebuchadnezzar answered them, “Is it on purpose, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, that you don’t serve my god, nor worship the golden image which I have set up? Now if you are ready whenever you hear the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp, pipe, and all kinds of music to fall down and worship the image which I have made, good; but if you don’t worship, you shall be cast the same hour into the middle of a burning fiery furnace. Who is that god who will deliver you out of my hands?”

Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego answered the king, “Nebuchadnezzar, we have no need to answer you in this matter. If it happens, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace; and he will deliver us out of your hand, O king. But if not, let it be known to you, O king, that we will not serve your gods or worship the golden image which you have set up.”

Then Nebuchadnezzar was full of fury, and the form of his appearance was changed against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. He spoke, and commanded that they should heat the furnace seven times more than it was usually heated. He commanded certain mighty men who were in his army to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, and to cast them into the burning fiery furnace. Then these men were bound in their pants, their tunics, their mantles, and their other clothes, and were cast into the middle of the burning fiery furnace. Therefore because the king’s commandment was urgent, and the furnace exceedingly hot, the flame of the fire killed those men who took up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. These three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, fell down bound into the middle of the burning fiery furnace.

THE SONG OF THE THREE HOLY CHILDREN

They walked in the midst of the fire, praising God, and blessing the Lord. Then Azarias stood, and prayed like this. Opening his mouth in the midst of the fire he said, “Blessed are you, O Lord, you God of our fathers! Your name is worthy to be praised and glorified for evermore; for you are righteous in all the things that you have done. Yes, all your works are true. Your ways are right, and all your judgments are truth. In all the things that you have brought upon us, and upon the holy city of our fathers, Jerusalem, you have executed true judgments. For according to truth and justice you have brought all these things upon us because of our sins. For we have sinned and committed iniquity in departing from you. In all things we have trespassed, and not obeyed your commandments or kept them. We haven’t done as you have commanded us, that it might go well with us. Therefore all that you have brought upon us, and everything that you have done to us, you have done in true judgment. You delivered us into the hands of lawless enemies, most hateful rebels, and to an unjust king who is the most wicked in all the world. And now we can’t open our mouth. Shame and reproach have come on your servants and those who worship you. Don’t utterly deliver us up, for your name’s sake. Don’t annul your covenant. Don’t cause your mercy to depart from us, for the sake of Abraham who is loved by you, and for the sake of Isaac your servant, and Israel your holy one, to whom you promised that you would multiply their offspring as the stars of the sky, and as the sand that is on the sea shore. For we, O Lord, have become less than any nation, and are brought low this day in all the world because of our sins. There isn’t at this time prince, or prophet, or leader, or burnt offering, or sacrifice, or oblation, or incense, or place to offer before you, and to find mercy. Nevertheless in a contrite heart and a humble spirit let us be accepted, like the burnt offerings of rams and bullocks, and like ten thousands of fat lambs. So let our sacrifice be in your sight this day, that we may wholly go after you, for they shall not be ashamed who put their trust in you. And now we follow you with all our heart. We fear you, and seek your face. Put us not to shame; but deal with us after your kindness, and according to the multitude of your mercy. Deliver us also according to your marvelous works, and give glory to your name, O Lord. Let all those who harm your servants be confounded. Let them be ashamed of all their power and might, and let their strength be broken. Let them know that you are the Lord, the only God, and glorious over the whole world.”

The king’s servants who put them in didn’t stop making the furnace hot with naphtha, pitch, tinder, and small wood, so that the flame streamed out forty nine cubits above the furnace. It spread and burned those Chaldeans whom it found around the furnace. But the angel of the Lord came down into the furnace together with Azarias and his fellows, and he struck the flame of the fire out of the furnace, and made the midst of the furnace as it had been a moist whistling wind, so that the fire didn’t touch them at all. It neither hurt nor troubled them.

Then the three, as out of one mouth, praised, glorified, and blessed God in the furnace, saying, “Blessed are you, O Lord, you God of our fathers, to be praised and exalted above all forever! Blessed is your glorious and holy name, to be praised and exalted above all forever! Blessed are you in the temple of your holy glory, to be praised and glorified above all forever! Blessed are you who see the depths and sit upon the cherubim, to be praised and exalted above all forever. Blessed are you on the throne of your kingdom, to be praised and extolled above all forever! Blessed are you in the firmament of heaven, to be praised and glorified forever!

O all you works of the Lord, bless the Lord! Praise and exalt him above all forever! O you heavens, bless the Lord! Praise and exalt him above all for ever! O you angels of the Lord, bless the Lord! Praise and exalt him above all forever! O all you waters that are above the sky, bless the Lord! Praise and exalt him above all forever! O all you powers of the Lord, bless the Lord! Praise and exalt him above all forever! O you sun and moon, bless the Lord! Praise and exalt him above all forever! O you stars of heaven, bless the Lord! Praise and exalt him above all forever! O every shower and dew, bless the Lord! Praise and exalt him above all forever! O all you winds, bless the Lord! Praise and exalt him above all forever! O you fire and heat, bless the Lord! Praise and exalt him above all forever! O you dews and storms of snow, bless the Lord! Praise and exalt him above all forever! O you nights and days, bless the Lord! Praise and exalt him above all forever! O you light and darkness, bless the Lord! Praise and exalt him above all forever! O you cold and heat, bless the Lord! Praise and exalt him above all forever! O you frost and snow, bless the Lord! Praise and exalt him above all forever! O you lightnings and clouds, bless the Lord! Praise and exalt him above all forever! O let the earth bless the Lord! Let it praise and exalt him above all forever! O you mountains and hills, bless the Lord! Praise and exalt him above all forever! O all you things that grow on the earth, bless the Lord! Praise and exalt him above all forever! O sea and rivers, bless the Lord! Praise and exalt him above all forever! O you springs, bless the Lord! Praise and exalt him above all forever! O you whales and all that move in the waters, bless the Lord! Praise and exalt him above all forever! O all you birds of the air, bless the Lord! Praise and exalt him above all forever! O all you beasts and cattle, bless the Lord! Praise and exalt him above all forever! O you children of men, bless the Lord! Praise and exalt him above all forever! O let Israel bless the Lord! Praise and exalt him above all forever. O you priests of the Lord, bless the Lord! Praise and exalt him above all forever! O you servants of the Lord, bless the Lord! Praise and exalt him above all forever! O you spirits and souls of the righteous, bless the Lord! Praise and exalt him above all forever! O you who are holy and humble of heart, bless the Lord! Praise and exalt him above all forever! O Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, bless the Lord! Praise and exalt him above all forever; for he has rescued us from Hades, and saved us from the hand of death! He has delivered us out of the midst of the furnace and burning flame. He has delivered us out of the midst of the fire. O give thanks to the Lord, for he is good; for his mercy is forever. O all you who worship the Lord, bless the God of gods, praise him, and give him thanks; for his mercy is forever!”

Deliverance from the Furnace

Then Nebuchadnezzar the king was astonished and rose up in haste. He spoke and said to his counselors, “Didn’t we cast three men bound into the middle of the fire?”

They answered the king, “True, O king.”

He answered, “Look, I see four men loose, walking in the middle of the fire, and they are unharmed. The appearance of the fourth is like a son of the gods.”

Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the mouth of the burning fiery furnace. He spoke and said, “Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, you servants of the Most High God, come out, and come here!”

Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego came out of the middle of the fire. The local governors, the deputies, and the governors, and the king’s counselors, being gathered together, saw these men, that the fire had no power on their bodies. The hair of their head wasn’t singed. Their pants weren’t changed. The smell of fire wasn’t even on them.

Nebuchadnezzar spoke and said, “Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, who has sent his angel and delivered his servants who trusted in him, and have changed the king’s word, and have yielded their bodies, that they might not serve nor worship any god, except their own God. Therefore I make a decree, that every people, nation, and language, who speak anything evil against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, shall be cut in pieces, and their houses shall be made a dunghill, because there is no other god who is able to deliver like this.”

Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego in the province of Babylon.

### Chapter 4

Nebuchadnezzar the king,

to all the peoples, nations, and languages, who dwell in all the earth:

Peace be multiplied to you.

It has seemed good to me to show the signs and wonders that the Most High God has worked toward me.

How great are his signs!

How mighty are his wonders!

His kingdom is an everlasting kingdom.

His dominion is from generation to generation.

I, Nebuchadnezzar, was at rest in my house, and flourishing in my palace. I saw a dream which made me afraid; and the thoughts on my bed and the visions of my head troubled me. Therefore I made a decree to bring in all the wise men of Babylon before me, that they might make known to me the interpretation of the dream. Then the magicians, the enchanters, the Chaldeans, and the soothsayers came in; and I told the dream before them; but they didn’t make known to me its interpretation. But at the last Daniel came in before me, whose name was Belteshazzar, according to the name of my god, and in whom is the spirit of the holy gods. I told the dream before him, saying,

“Belteshazzar, master of the magicians, because I know that the spirit of the holy gods is in you, and no secret troubles you, tell me the visions of my dream that I have seen, and its interpretation. These were the visions of my head on my bed: I saw, and behold, a tree in the middle of the earth; and its height was great. The tree grew, and was strong, and its height reached to the sky, and its sight to the end of all the earth. Its leaves were beautiful, and it had much fruit, and in it was food for all. The animals of the field had shade under it, and the birds of the sky lived in its branches, and all flesh was fed from it.

“I saw in the visions of my head on my bed, and behold, a watcher and a holy one came down from the sky. He cried aloud, and said this, ‘Cut down the tree and cut off its branches! Shake off its leaves and scatter its fruit! Let the animals get away from under it, and the fowls from its branches. Nevertheless leave the stump of its roots in the earth, even with a band of iron and bronze, in the tender grass of the field; and let it be wet with the dew of the sky. Let his portion be with the animals in the grass of the earth. Let his heart be changed from man’s, and let an animal’s heart be given to him. Then let seven times pass over him.

“‘The sentence is by the decree of the watchers, and the demand by the word of the holy ones, to the intent that the living may know that the Most High rules in the kingdom of men, and gives it to whomever he will, and sets up over it the lowest of men.’

“This dream I, King Nebuchadnezzar, have seen; and you, Belteshazzar, declare the interpretation, because all the wise men of my kingdom are not able to make known to me the interpretation; but you are able, for the spirit of the holy gods is in you.”

Then Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, was stricken mute for a while, and his thoughts troubled him. The king answered, “Belteshazzar, don’t let the dream, or the interpretation, trouble you.”

Belteshazzar answered, “My lord, may the dream be for those who hate you, and its interpretation to your adversaries. The tree that you saw, which grew and was strong, whose height reached to the sky, and its sight to all the earth; whose leaves were beautiful, and its fruit plentiful, and in it was food for all; under which the animals of the field lived, and on whose branches the birds of the sky had their habitation— it is you, O king, who have grown and become strong; for your greatness has grown, and reaches to the sky, and your dominion to the end of the earth.

“Whereas the king saw a watcher and a holy one coming down from the sky, and saying, ‘Cut down the tree, and destroy it; nevertheless leave the stump of its roots in the earth, even with a band of iron and bronze, in the tender grass of the field, and let it be wet with the dew of the sky. Let his portion be with the animals of the field, until seven times pass over him.’

“This is the interpretation, O king, and it is the decree of the Most High, which has come on my lord the king: that you shall be driven from men, and your dwelling shall be with the animals of the field. You shall be made to eat grass as oxen, and shall be wet with the dew of the sky, and seven times shall pass over you; until you know that the Most High rules in the kingdom of men, and gives it to whomever he will. Their command to leave the stump of the roots of the tree means your kingdom will be sure to you, after you will have known that the heavens do rule. Therefore, O king, let my counsel be acceptable to you, and break off your sins by righteousness, and your iniquities by showing mercy to the poor. Perhaps there may be a lengthening of your tranquility.”

All this came on the King Nebuchadnezzar. At the end of twelve months he was walking in the royal palace of Babylon. The king spoke and said, “Is not this great Babylon, which I have built for the royal dwelling place, by the might of my power and for the glory of my majesty?”

While the word was in the king’s mouth, a voice came from the sky, saying, “O King Nebuchadnezzar, to you it is spoken: ‘The kingdom has departed from you. You shall be driven from men, and your dwelling shall be with the animals of the field. You shall be made to eat grass as oxen. Seven times shall pass over you, until you know that the Most High rules in the kingdom of men, and gives it to whomever he will.’”

This was fulfilled the same hour on Nebuchadnezzar. He was driven from men, and ate grass as oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of the sky, until his hair had grown like eagles’ feathers, and his nails like birds’ claws.

At the end of the days I, Nebuchadnezzar, lifted up my eyes to heaven, and my understanding returned to me, and I blessed the Most High, and I praised and honored him who lives forever.

For his dominion is an everlasting dominion,

and his kingdom from generation to generation.

All the inhabitants of the earth are reputed as nothing;

and he does according to his will in the army of heaven,

and among the inhabitants of the earth;

and no one can stop his hand,

or ask him, “What are you doing?”

At the same time my understanding returned to me; and for the glory of my kingdom, my majesty and brightness returned to me. My counselors and my lords sought me; and I was established in my kingdom, and excellent greatness was added to me. Now I, Nebuchadnezzar, praise and extol and honor the King of heaven; for all his works are right and his ways just; and those who walk in pride he is able to humble.

### Chapter 5

Belshazzar the king made a great feast to a thousand of his lords, and drank wine before the thousand. Belshazzar, while he tasted the wine, commanded that the golden and silver vessels which Nebuchadnezzar his father had taken out of the temple which was in Jerusalem be brought to him, that the king and his lords, his wives and his concubines, might drink from them. Then they brought the golden vessels that were taken out of the temple of God’s house which was at Jerusalem; and the king and his lords, his wives and his concubines, drank from them. They drank wine, and praised the gods of gold, and of silver, of bronze, of iron, of wood, and of stone.

In the same hour, the fingers of a man’s hand came out and wrote near the lamp stand on the plaster of the wall of the king’s palace. The king saw the part of the hand that wrote. Then the king’s face was changed in him, and his thoughts troubled him; and the joints of his thighs were loosened, and his knees struck one against another.

The king cried aloud to bring in the enchanters, the Chaldeans, and the soothsayers. The king spoke and said to the wise men of Babylon, “Whoever reads this writing and shows me its interpretation shall be clothed with purple, and have a chain of gold about his neck, and shall be the third ruler in the kingdom.”

Then all the king’s wise men came in; but they could not read the writing and couldn’t make known to the king the interpretation. Then King Belshazzar was greatly troubled. His face was changed in him, and his lords were perplexed.

The queen by reason of the words of the king and his lords came into the banquet house. The queen spoke and said, “O king, live forever; don’t let your thoughts trouble you, nor let your face be changed. There is a man in your kingdom in whom is the spirit of the holy gods. In the days of your father, light, understanding, and wisdom like the wisdom of the gods were found in him. The king, Nebuchadnezzar, your father—yes, the king, your father—made him master of the magicians, enchanters, Chaldeans, and soothsayers because an excellent spirit, knowledge, understanding, interpreting of dreams, showing of dark sentences, and dissolving of doubts were found in the same Daniel, whom the king named Belteshazzar. Now let Daniel be called, and he will show the interpretation.”

Then Daniel was brought in before the king. The king spoke and said to Daniel, “Are you that Daniel of the children of the captivity of Judah, whom the king my father brought out of Judah? I have heard of you, that the spirit of the gods is in you, and that light, understanding, and excellent wisdom are found in you. Now the wise men, the enchanters, have been brought in before me to read this writing, and make known to me its interpretation; but they could not show the interpretation of the thing. But I have heard of you, that you can give interpretations and dissolve doubts. Now if you can read the writing, and make known to me its interpretation, you shall be clothed with purple, and have a chain of gold around your neck, and shall be the third ruler in the kingdom.”

Then Daniel answered the king, “Let your gifts be to yourself, and give your rewards to another. Nevertheless, I will read the writing to the king, and make known to him the interpretation.

“To you, king, the Most High God gave Nebuchadnezzar your father the kingdom, and greatness, and glory, and majesty. Because of the greatness that he gave him, all the peoples, nations, and languages trembled and feared before him. He killed whom he wanted to, and he kept alive whom he wanted to. He raised up whom he wanted to, and he put down whom he wanted to. But when his heart was lifted up, and his spirit was hardened so that he dealt proudly, he was deposed from his kingly throne, and they took his glory from him. He was driven from the sons of men and his heart was made like the animals’, and his dwelling was with the wild donkeys. He was fed with grass like oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of the sky, until he knew that the Most High God rules in the kingdom of men, and that he sets up over it whomever he will.

“You, his son, Belshazzar, have not humbled your heart, though you knew all this, but have lifted up yourself against the Lord of heaven; and they have brought the vessels of his house before you, and you and your lords, your wives, and your concubines, have drunk wine from them. You have praised the gods of silver, gold, bronze, iron, wood, and stone, which don’t see, hear, or know; and you have not glorified the God in whose hand is your breath and whose are all your ways. Then the part of the hand was sent from before him, and this writing was inscribed.

“This is the writing that was inscribed: ‘MENE, MENE, TEKEL, UPHARSIN.’

“This is the interpretation of the thing:

MENE: God has counted your kingdom, and brought it to an end.

TEKEL: you are weighed in the balances, and are found wanting.

PERES: your kingdom is divided, and given to the Medes and Persians.”

Then Belshazzar commanded, and they clothed Daniel with purple, and put a chain of gold about his neck, and proclaimed that he should be the third highest ruler in the kingdom.

In that night Belshazzar the Chaldean King was slain. Darius the Mede received the kingdom, being about sixty-two years old.

### Chapter 6

It pleased Darius to set over the kingdom one hundred twenty local governors, who should be throughout the whole kingdom; and over them three presidents, of whom Daniel was one; that these local governors might give account to them, and that the king should suffer no loss. Then this Daniel was distinguished above the presidents and the local governors, because an excellent spirit was in him; and the king thought to set him over the whole realm.

Then the presidents and the local governors sought to find occasion against Daniel as touching the kingdom; but they could find no occasion or fault, because he was faithful. There wasn’t any error or fault found in him. Then these men said, “We won’t find any occasion against this Daniel, unless we find it against him concerning the law of his God.”

Then these presidents and local governors assembled together to the king, and said this to him, “King Darius, live forever! All the presidents of the kingdom, the deputies and the local governors, the counselors and the governors, have consulted together to establish a royal statute, and to make a strong decree, that whoever asks a petition of any god or man for thirty days, except of you, O king, he shall be cast into the den of lions. Now, O king, establish the decree, and sign the writing, that it not be changed, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which doesn’t alter.” Therefore King Darius signed the writing and the decree.

When Daniel knew that the writing was signed, he went into his house (now his windows were open in his room toward Jerusalem) and he kneeled on his knees three times a day, and prayed, and gave thanks before his God, as he did before. Then these men assembled together, and found Daniel making petition and supplication before his God. Then they came near, and spoke before the king concerning the king’s decree: “Haven’t you signed a decree that every man who makes a petition to any god or man within thirty days, except to you, O king, shall be cast into the den of lions?”

The king answered, “This thing is true, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which doesn’t alter.”

Then they answered and said before the king, “That Daniel, who is of the children of the captivity of Judah, doesn’t respect you, O king, nor the decree that you have signed, but makes his petition three times a day.” Then the king, when he heard these words, was very displeased, and set his heart on Daniel to deliver him; and he labored until the going down of the sun to rescue him.

Then these men assembled together to the king, and said to the king, “Know, O king, that it is a law of the Medes and Persians, that no decree nor statute which the king establishes may be changed.”

Then the king commanded, and they brought Daniel, and cast him into the den of lions. The king spoke and said to Daniel, “Your God whom you serve continually, he will deliver you.”

A stone was brought, and laid on the mouth of the den; and the king sealed it with his own signet, and with the signet of his lords, that nothing might be changed concerning Daniel. Then the king went to his palace, and passed the night fasting. No musical instruments were brought before him; and his sleep fled from him.

Then the king arose very early in the morning, and went in haste to the den of lions. When he came near to the den to Daniel, he cried with a troubled voice. The king spoke and said to Daniel, “Daniel, servant of the living God, is your God, whom you serve continually, able to deliver you from the lions?”

Then Daniel said to the king, “O king, live forever! My God has sent his angel, and has shut the lions’ mouths, and they have not hurt me; because I am innocent in his sight. Also before you, O king, I have done no harm.”

Then the king was exceedingly glad, and commanded that they should take Daniel up out of the den. So Daniel was taken up out of the den, and no kind of harm was found on him, because he had trusted in his God.

The king commanded, and they brought those men who had accused Daniel, and they cast them into the den of lions—them, their children, and their wives; and the lions mauled them and broke all their bones in pieces before they came to the bottom of the den.

Then King Darius wrote to all the peoples, nations, and languages, who dwell in all the earth:

“Peace be multiplied to you.

“I make a decree that in all the dominion of my kingdom men tremble and fear before the God of Daniel;

“for he is the living God,

and steadfast forever.

His kingdom is that which will not be destroyed.

His dominion will be even to the end.

He delivers and rescues.

He works signs and wonders in heaven and in earth,

who has delivered Daniel from the power of the lions.”

So this Daniel prospered in the reign of Darius, and in the reign of Cyrus the Persian.

### Chapter 7

In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon, Daniel had a dream and visions of his head on his bed. Then he wrote the dream and told the sum of the matters.

Daniel spoke and said, “I saw in my vision by night and behold, the four winds of the sky broke out on the great sea. Four great animals came up from the sea, different from one another.

“The first was like a lion, and had eagle’s wings. I watched until its wings were plucked, and it was lifted up from the earth, and made to stand on two feet as a man. A man’s heart was given to it.

“Behold, there was another animal, a second, like a bear. It was raised up on one side, and three ribs were in its mouth between its teeth. They said this to it: ‘Arise! Devour much flesh!’

“After this I saw, and behold, another, like a leopard, which had on its back four wings of a bird. The animal also had four heads; and dominion was given to it.

“After this I saw in the night visions, and, behold, there was a fourth animal, awesome and powerful, and exceedingly strong. It had great iron teeth. It devoured and broke in pieces, and stamped the residue with its feet. It was different from all the animals that were before it. It had ten horns.

“I considered the horns, and behold, another horn came up among them, a little one, before which three of the first horns were plucked up by the roots: and behold, in this horn were eyes like the eyes of a man, and a mouth speaking great things.

“I watched until thrones were placed,

and one who was ancient of days sat.

His clothing was white as snow,

and the hair of his head like pure wool.

His throne was fiery flames,

and its wheels burning fire.

A fiery stream issued and came out from before him.

Thousands of thousands ministered to him.

Ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him.

The judgment was set.

The books were opened.

“I watched at that time because of the voice of the great words which the horn spoke. I watched even until the animal was slain, its body destroyed, and it was given to be burned with fire. As for the rest of the animals, their dominion was taken away; yet their lives were prolonged for a season and a time.

“I saw in the night visions, and behold, one like a son of man came with the clouds, and he came to the ancient of days, and they brought him near before him. Dominion was given him, with glory and a kingdom, that all the peoples, nations, and languages should serve him. His dominion is an everlasting dominion, which will not pass away, and his kingdom will not be destroyed.

“As for me, Daniel, my spirit was grieved within my body, and the visions of my head troubled me. I came near to one of those who stood by, and asked him the truth concerning all this.

“So he told me, and made me know the interpretation of the things. ‘These great animals, which are four, are four kings, who will arise out of the earth. But the saints of the Most High will receive the kingdom, and possess the kingdom forever, even forever and ever.’

“Then I desired to know the truth concerning the fourth animal, which was different from all of them, exceedingly terrible, whose teeth were of iron, and its nails of bronze; which devoured, broke in pieces, and stamped the residue with its feet; and concerning the ten horns that were on its head, and the other horn which came up, and before which three fell, even that horn that had eyes, and a mouth that spoke great things, whose look was more stout than its fellows. I saw, and the same horn made war with the saints and prevailed against them until the ancient of days came, and judgment was given to the saints of the Most High, and the time came that the saints possessed the kingdom.

“So he said, ‘The fourth animal will be a fourth kingdom on earth, which will be different from all the kingdoms, and will devour the whole earth, and will tread it down, and break it in pieces. As for the ten horns, ten kings will arise out of this kingdom. Another will arise after them; and he will be different from the former, and he will put down three kings. He will speak words against the Most High, and will wear out the saints of the Most High. He will plan to change the times and the law; and they will be given into his hand until a time and times and half a time.

“‘But the judgment will be set, and they will take away his dominion, to consume and to destroy it to the end. The kingdom and the dominion, and the greatness of the kingdoms under the whole sky, will be given to the people of the saints of the Most High. His kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions will serve and obey him.’

“Here is the end of the matter. As for me, Daniel, my thoughts troubled me greatly, and my face was changed in me; but I kept the matter in my heart.”

### Chapter 8

In the third year of the reign of King Belshazzar, a vision appeared to me, even to me, Daniel, after that which appeared to me at the first. I saw the vision. Now it was so, that when I saw, I was in the citadel of Susa, which is in the province of Elam. I saw in the vision, and I was by the river Ulai. Then I lifted up my eyes, and saw, and behold, a ram which had two horns stood before the river. The two horns were high; but one was higher than the other, and the higher came up last. I saw the ram pushing westward, northward, and southward. No animals could stand before him. There wasn’t anyone who could deliver out of his hand; but he did according to his will, and magnified himself.

As I was considering, behold, a male goat came from the west over the surface of the whole earth, and didn’t touch the ground. The goat had a notable horn between his eyes. He came to the ram that had the two horns, which I saw standing before the river, and ran on him in the fury of his power. I saw him come close to the ram, and he was moved with anger against him, and struck the ram, and broke his two horns. There was no power in the ram to stand before him; but he cast him down to the ground, and trampled on him. There was no one who could deliver the ram out of his hand. The male goat magnified himself exceedingly. When he was strong, the great horn was broken; and instead of it there came up four notable horns toward the four winds of the sky.

Out of one of them came out a little horn, which grew exceedingly great, toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the glorious land. It grew great, even to the army of the sky; and it cast down some of the army and of the stars to the ground, and trampled on them. Yes, it magnified itself, even to the prince of the army; and it took away from him the continual burnt offering, and the place of his sanctuary was cast down. The army was given over to it together with the continual burnt offering through disobedience. It cast down truth to the ground, and it did its pleasure and prospered.

Then I heard a holy one speaking; and another holy one said to that certain one who spoke, “How long will the vision about the continual burnt offering, and the disobedience that makes desolate, to give both the sanctuary and the army to be trodden under foot be?”

He said to me, “To two thousand and three hundred evenings and mornings. Then the sanctuary will be cleansed.”

When I, even I Daniel, had seen the vision, I sought to understand it. Then behold, there stood before me something like the appearance of a man. I heard a man’s voice between the banks of the Ulai, which called, and said, “Gabriel, make this man understand the vision.”

So he came near where I stood; and when he came, I was frightened, and fell on my face; but he said to me, “Understand, son of man; for the vision belongs to the time of the end.”

Now as he was speaking with me, I fell into a deep sleep with my face toward the ground; but he touched me, and set me upright.

He said, “Behold, I will make you know what will be in the latter time of the indignation; for it belongs to the appointed time of the end. The ram which you saw, that had the two horns, they are the kings of Media and Persia. The rough male goat is the king of Greece. The great horn that is between his eyes is the first king. As for that which was broken, in the place where four stood up, four kingdoms will stand up out of the nation, but not with his power.

“In the latter time of their kingdom, when the transgressors have come to the full, a king of fierce face, and understanding dark sentences, will stand up. His power will be mighty, but not by his own power. He will destroy awesomely, and will prosper in what he does. He will destroy the mighty ones and the holy people. Through his policy he will cause deceit to prosper in his hand. He will magnify himself in his heart, and he will destroy many in their security. He will also stand up against the prince of princes; but he will be broken without human power.

“The vision of the evenings and mornings which has been told is true; but seal up the vision, for it belongs to many days to come.”

I, Daniel, fainted, and was sick for some days. Then I rose up, and did the king’s business. I wondered at the vision, but no one understood it.

### Chapter 9

In the first year of Darius the son of Ahasuerus, of the offspring of the Medes, who was made king over the realm of the Chaldeans, in the first year of his reign I, Daniel, understood by the books the number of the years about which Yahweh’s word came to Jeremiah the prophet, for the accomplishing of the desolations of Jerusalem, even seventy years. I set my face to the Lord God, to seek by prayer and petitions, with fasting in sackcloth and ashes.

I prayed to Yahweh my God, and made confession, and said,

“Oh, Lord, the great and dreadful God, who keeps covenant and loving kindness with those who love him and keep his commandments, we have sinned, and have dealt perversely, and have done wickedly, and have rebelled, even turning aside from your precepts and from your ordinances. We haven’t listened to your servants the prophets, who spoke in your name to our kings, our princes, and our fathers, and to all the people of the land.

“Lord, righteousness belongs to you, but to us confusion of face, as it is today—to the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and to all Israel, who are near, and who are far off, through all the countries where you have driven them, because of their trespass that they have trespassed against you. Lord, to us belongs confusion of face, to our kings, to our princes, and to our fathers, because we have sinned against you. To the Lord our God belong mercies and forgiveness; for we have rebelled against him. We haven’t obeyed Yahweh our God’s voice, to walk in his laws, which he set before us by his servants the prophets. Yes, all Israel have transgressed your law, turning aside, that they wouldn’t obey your voice.

“Therefore the curse and the oath written in the law of Moses the servant of God has been poured out on us; for we have sinned against him. He has confirmed his words, which he spoke against us, and against our judges who judged us, by bringing on us a great evil; for under the whole sky, such has not been done as has been done to Jerusalem. As it is written in the law of Moses, all this evil has come on us. Yet we have not entreated the favor of Yahweh our God, that we should turn from our iniquities and have discernment in your truth. Therefore Yahweh has watched over the evil, and brought it on us; for Yahweh our God is righteous in all his works which he does, and we have not obeyed his voice.

“Now, Lord our God, who has brought your people out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand, and have gotten yourself renown, as it is today, we have sinned. We have done wickedly. Lord, according to all your righteousness, please let your anger and your wrath be turned away from your city Jerusalem, your holy mountain, because for our sins, and for the iniquities of our fathers, Jerusalem and your people have become a reproach to all who are around us.

“Now therefore, our God, listen to the prayer of your servant, and to his petitions, and cause your face to shine on your sanctuary that is desolate, for the Lord’s sake. My God, turn your ear and hear. Open your eyes and see our desolations and the city which is called by your name; for we don’t present our petitions before you for our righteousness, but for your great mercies’ sake. Lord, hear. Lord, forgive. Lord, listen and do. Don’t defer, for your own sake, my God, because your city and your people are called by your name.”

While I was speaking, praying, and confessing my sin and the sin of my people Israel, and presenting my supplication before Yahweh my God for the holy mountain of my God— yes, while I was speaking in prayer, the man Gabriel, whom I had seen in the vision at the beginning, being caused to fly swiftly, touched me about the time of the evening offering. He instructed me and talked with me, and said, “Daniel, I have now come to give you wisdom and understanding. At the beginning of your petitions the commandment went out and I have come to tell you, for you are greatly beloved. Therefore consider the matter and understand the vision.

“Seventy weeks are decreed on your people and on your holy city, to finish disobedience, to put an end to sin, to make reconciliation for iniquity, to bring in everlasting righteousness, to seal up vision and prophecy, and to anoint the most holy.

“Know therefore and discern that from the going out of the commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem to the Anointed One, the prince, will be seven weeks and sixty-two weeks. It will be built again with street and moat, even in troubled times. After the sixty-two weeks the Anointed One will be cut off and will have nothing. The people of the prince who come will destroy the city and the sanctuary. Its end will be with a flood, and war will be even to the end. Desolations are determined. He will make a firm covenant with many for one week. In the middle of the week he will cause the sacrifice and the offering to cease. On the wing of abominations will come one who makes desolate. Even to the full end that is decreed, wrath will be poured out on the desolate.”

### Chapter 10

In the third year of Cyrus king of Persia a revelation was revealed to Daniel, whose name was called Belteshazzar. The revelation was true, even a great warfare. He understood the revelation, and had understanding of the vision.

In those days I, Daniel, was mourning three whole weeks. I ate no pleasant bread. No meat or wine came into my mouth. I didn’t anoint myself at all, until three whole weeks were fulfilled.

In the twenty-fourth day of the first month, as I was by the side of the great river, which is Hiddekel, I lifted up my eyes and looked, and behold, there was a man clothed in linen, whose thighs were adorned with pure gold of Uphaz. His body also was like beryl, and his face like the appearance of lightning, and his eyes like flaming torches. His arms and his feet were like burnished bronze. The voice of his words was like the voice of a multitude.

I, Daniel, alone saw the vision; for the men who were with me didn’t see the vision; but a great quaking fell on them, and they fled to hide themselves. So I was left alone, and saw this great vision. No strength remained in me; for my face grew deathly pale, and I retained no strength. Yet I heard the voice of his words. When I heard the voice of his words, then I fell into a deep sleep on my face, with my face toward the ground.

Behold, a hand touched me, which set me on my knees and on the palms of my hands. He said to me, “Daniel, you greatly beloved man, understand the words that I speak to you. Stand upright, for I have been sent to you, now.” When he had spoken this word to me, I stood trembling.

Then he said to me, “Don’t be afraid, Daniel; for from the first day that you set your heart to understand, and to humble yourself before your God, your words were heard. I have come for your words’ sake. But the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me twenty-one days; but, behold, Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me because I remained there with the kings of Persia. Now I have come to make you understand what will happen to your people in the latter days; for the vision is yet for many days.”

When he had spoken these words to me, I set my face toward the ground, and was mute. Behold, one in the likeness of the sons of men touched my lips. Then I opened my mouth, and spoke and said to him who stood before me, “My lord, by reason of the vision my sorrows have overtaken me, and I retain no strength. For how can the servant of my lord talk with my lord? For as for me, immediately there remained no strength in me. There was no breath left in me.”

Then one like the appearance of a man touched me again, and he strengthened me. He said, “Greatly beloved man, don’t be afraid. Peace be to you. Be strong. Yes, be strong.”

When he spoke to me, I was strengthened, and said, “Let my lord speak; for you have strengthened me.”

Then he said, “Do you know why I have come to you? Now I will return to fight with the prince of Persia. When I go out, behold, the prince of Greece will come. But I will tell you what is inscribed in the writing of truth. There is no one who supports me against these except Michael, your prince.

### Chapter 11

“As for me, in the first year of Darius the Mede, I stood up to confirm and strengthen him.

“Now I will show you the truth. Behold, three more kings will stand up in Persia. The fourth will be far richer than all of them. When he has grown strong through his riches, he will stir up all against the realm of Greece. A mighty king will stand up who will rule with great dominion, and do according to his will. When he stands up, his kingdom will be broken, and will be divided toward the four winds of the sky, but not to his posterity, nor according to his dominion with which he ruled; for his kingdom will be plucked up, even for others besides these.

“The king of the south will be strong. One of his princes will become stronger than him and have dominion. His dominion will be a great dominion. At the end of years they will join themselves together. The daughter of the king of the south will come to the king of the north to make an agreement, but she will not retain the strength of her arm. He will also not stand, nor will his arm; but she will be given up, with those who brought her and he who became her father, and he who strengthened her in those times.

“But out of a shoot from her roots one will stand up in his place who will come to the army and will enter into the fortress of the king of the north, and will deal against them and will prevail. He will also carry their gods, with their molten images and their precious vessels of silver and of gold, captive into Egypt. He will refrain some years from the king of the north. He will come into the realm of the king of the south, but he will return into his own land. His sons will wage war and will assemble a multitude of great forces which will keep coming and overflow and pass through. They will return and wage war, even to his fortress.

“The king of the south will be moved with anger and will come out and fight with him, even with the king of the north. He will send out a great multitude, and the multitude will be given into his hand. The multitude will be lifted up, and his heart will be exalted. He will cast down tens of thousands, but he won’t prevail. The king of the north will return, and will send out a multitude greater than the former. He will come on at the end of the times, even of years, with a great army and with abundant supplies.

“In those times many will stand up against the king of the south. Also the children of the violent among your people will lift themselves up to establish the vision; but they will fall. So the king of the north will come and cast up a mound, and take a well-fortified city. The forces of the south won’t stand, neither will his chosen people, neither will there be any strength to stand. But he who comes against him will do according to his own will, and no one will stand before him. He will stand in the glorious land, and destruction will be in his hand. He will set his face to come with the strength of his whole kingdom, and with him equitable conditions. He will perform them. He will give him the daughter of women to corrupt her; but she will not stand, and won’t be for him. After this he will turn his face to the islands, and will take many; but a prince will cause the reproach offered by him to cease. Yes, moreover, he will cause his reproach to turn on him. Then he will turn his face toward the fortresses of his own land; but he will stumble and fall, and won’t be found.

“Then one who will cause a tax collector to pass through the kingdom to maintain its glory will stand up in his place; but within few days he shall be destroyed, not in anger, and not in battle.

“In his place, a contemptible person will stand up, to whom they had not given the honor of the kingdom; but he will come in time of security, and will obtain the kingdom by flatteries. The overwhelming forces will be overwhelmed from before him, and will be broken. Yes, also the prince of the covenant. After the treaty is made with him, he will work deceitfully; for he will come up, and will become strong with a small people. In time of security, he will come even on the fattest places of the province. He will do that which his fathers have not done, nor his fathers’ fathers. He will scatter among them prey, plunder, and substance. Yes, he will devise his plans against the strongholds, even for a time.

“He will stir up his power and his courage against the king of the south with a great army; and the king of the south will wage war in battle with an exceedingly great and mighty army; but he won’t stand, for they will devise plans against him. Yes, those who eat of his delicacies will destroy him, and his army will be swept away. Many will fall down slain. As for both these kings, their hearts will be to do mischief, and they will speak lies at one table; but it won’t prosper, for the end will still be at the appointed time. Then he will return into his land with great wealth. His heart will be against the holy covenant. He will take action and return to his own land.

“He will return at the appointed time and come into the south; but it won’t be in the latter time as it was in the former. For ships of Kittim will come against him. Therefore he will be grieved, and will return, and have indignation against the holy covenant, and will take action. He will even return, and have regard to those who forsake the holy covenant.

“Forces will stand on his part and they will profane the sanctuary, even the fortress, and will take away the continual burnt offering. Then they will set up the abomination that makes desolate. He will corrupt those who do wickedly against the covenant by flatteries; but the people who know their God will be strong and take action.

“Those who are wise among the people will instruct many; yet they will fall by the sword and by flame, by captivity and by plunder, many days. Now when they fall, they will be helped with a little help; but many will join themselves to them with flatteries. Some of those who are wise will fall, to refine them, and to purify, and to make them white, even to the time of the end; because it is yet for the appointed time.

“The king will do according to his will. He will exalt himself, and magnify himself above every god, and will speak marvelous things against the God of gods. He will prosper until the indignation is accomplished; for what is determined will be done. He won’t regard the gods of his fathers, or the desire of women, or regard any god; for he will magnify himself above all. But in his place he will honor the god of fortresses. He will honor a god whom his fathers didn’t know with gold, silver, precious stones, and pleasant things. He will deal with the strongest fortresses by the help of a foreign god. He will increase with glory whoever acknowledges him. He will cause them to rule over many, and will divide the land for a price.

“At the time of the end, the king of the south will contend with him; and the king of the north will come against him like a whirlwind, with chariots, with horsemen, and with many ships. He will enter into the countries, and will overflow and pass through. He will enter also into the glorious land, and many countries will be overthrown; but these will be delivered out of his hand: Edom, Moab, and the chief of the children of Ammon. He will also stretch out his hand against the countries. The land of Egypt won’t escape. But he will have power over the treasures of gold and of silver, and over all the precious things of Egypt. The Libyans and the Ethiopians will be at his steps. But news out of the east and out of the north will trouble him; and he will go out with great fury to destroy and utterly to sweep away many. He will plant the tents of his palace between the sea and the glorious holy mountain; yet he will come to his end, and no one will help him.

### Chapter 12

“At that time Michael will stand up, the great prince who stands for the children of your people. There will be a time of trouble, such as never was since there was a nation even to that same time. At that time, your people will be delivered—everyone who is found written in the book. Many of those who sleep in the dust of the earth will awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting contempt. Those who are wise will shine as the brightness of the expanse. Those who turn many to righteousness will shine like the stars forever and ever. But you, Daniel, shut up the words and seal the book, even to the time of the end. Many will run back and forth, and knowledge will be increased.”

Then I, Daniel, looked, and behold, two others stood, one on the river bank on this side, and the other on the river bank on that side. One said to the man clothed in linen, who was above the waters of the river, “How long will it be to the end of these wonders?”

I heard the man clothed in linen, who was above the waters of the river, when he held up his right hand and his left hand to heaven, and swore by him who lives forever that it will be for a time, times, and a half; and when they have finished breaking in pieces the power of the holy people, all these things will be finished.

I heard, but I didn’t understand. Then I said, “My lord, what will be the outcome of these things?”

He said, “Go your way, Daniel; for the words are shut up and sealed until the time of the end. Many will purify themselves, make themselves white, and be refined; but the wicked will do wickedly. None of the wicked will understand; but those who are wise will understand.

“From the time that the continual burnt offering is taken away and the abomination that makes desolate set up, there will be one thousand two hundred ninety days. Blessed is he who waits and comes to the one thousand three hundred thirty-five days.

“But go your way until the end; for you will rest and will stand in your inheritance at the end of the days.”

### Chapter 13

THE HISTORY OF SUSANNA

A man lived in Babylon, and his name was Joakim. He took a wife, whose name was Susanna, the daughter of Helkias, a very fair woman, and one who feared the Lord. Her parents were also righteous, and taught their daughter according to the law of Moses. Now Joakim was a great rich man, and had a beautiful garden next to his house. The Jews used to come to him, because he was more honorable than all others. The same year, two of the elders of the people were appointed to be judges, such as the Lord spoke of, that wickedness came from Babylon from elders who were judges, who were supposed to govern the people. These were often at Joakim’s house. All that had any lawsuits came to them.

When the people departed away at noon, Susanna went into her husband’s garden to walk. The two elders saw her going in every day and walking; and they were inflamed with lust for her. They perverted their own mind and turned away their eyes, that they might not look to heaven, nor remember just judgments. And although they both were wounded with lust for her, yet dared not show the other his grief. For they were ashamed to declare their lust, what they desired to do with her. Yet they watched eagerly from day to day to see her. The one said to the other, “Let’s go home, now; for it is dinner time.” So when they had gone out, they parted company, and turning back again, they came to the same place. After they had asked one another the cause, they acknowledged their lust. Then they appointed a time both together, when they might find her alone.

It happened, as they watched on an opportune day, she went in as before with only two maids, and she desired to wash herself in the garden; for it was hot. There was nobody there except the two elders who had hid themselves and watched her. Then she said to her maids, “Bring me olive oil and ointment, and shut the garden doors, that I may wash myself.” They did as she asked them and shut the garden doors, and went out themselves at the side doors to fetch the things that she had commanded them. They didn’t see the elders, because they were hidden.

Now when the maids had gone out, the two elders rose up and ran to her, saying, “Behold, the garden doors are shut, that no man can see us, and we are in love with you. Therefore consent to us, and lie with us. If you will not, we will testify against you, that a young man was with you; therefore you sent your maids away from you.”

Then Susanna sighed, and said, “I am trapped; for if I do this thing, it is death to me. If I don’t do it, I can’t escape your hands. It is better for me to fall into your hands, and not do it, than to sin in the sight of the Lord.” With that Susanna cried with a loud voice; and the two elders cried out against her. Then one of them ran and opened the garden doors.

So when the servants of the house heard the cry in the garden, they rushed in at the side door to see what had happened to her. But when the elders had told their tale, the servants were greatly ashamed; for there was never such a report made of Susanna.

It came to pass on the next day, when the people assembled to her husband Joakim, the two elders came full of their wicked intent against Susanna to put her to death, and said before the people, “Send for Susanna, the daughter of Helkias, Joakim’s wife.” So they sent; and she came with her father and mother, her children, and all her kindred. Now Susanna was a very delicate woman, and beautiful to behold. These wicked men commanded her to be unveiled, for she was veiled, that they might be filled with her beauty. Therefore her friends and all who saw her wept. Then the two elders stood up in the midst of the people and laid their hands upon her head. She, weeping, looked up toward heaven; for her heart trusted in the Lord.

The elders said, “As we walked in the garden alone, this woman came in with two maids, shut the garden doors, and sent the maids away. Then a young man who was hidden there came to her and lay with her. And we, being in a corner of the garden, saw this wickedness and ran to them. And when we saw them together, we couldn’t hold the man; for he was stronger than we, and opened the doors, and leaped out. But having taken this woman, we asked who the young man was, but she would not tell us. We testify these things.

Then the assembly believed them, as those who were elders of the people and judges; so they condemned her to death.

Then Susanna cried out with a loud voice, and said, “O everlasting God, you know the secrets, and know all things before they happen. You know that they have testified falsely against me. Behold, I must die, even though I never did such things as these men have maliciously invented against me.”

The Lord heard her voice. Therefore when she was led away to be put to death, God raised up the holy spirit of a young youth, whose name was Daniel. He cried with a loud voice, “I am clear from the blood of this woman!”

Then all the people turned them toward him, and said, “What do these words that you have spoken mean?”

So he, standing in the midst of them, said, “Are you all such fools, you sons of Israel, that without examination or knowledge of the truth you have condemned a daughter of Israel? Return again to the place of judgment; for these have testified falsely against her.”

Therefore all the people turned again in haste, and the elders said to him, “Come, sit down among us, and show it to us, seeing God has given you the honor of an elder.”

Then Daniel said to them, “Put them far apart from each another, and I will examine them.” So when they were put apart one from another, he called one of them, and said to him, “O you who have become old in wickedness, now your sins have returned which you have committed before, in pronouncing unjust judgment, condemning the innocent, and letting the guilty go free; although the Lord says, ‘You shall not kill the innocent and righteous.’ Now then, if you saw her, tell me, under which tree did you see them companying together?”

He answered, “Under a mastick tree.”

And Daniel said, “You have certainly lied against your own head; for even now the angel of God has received the sentence of God and will cut you in two.” So he put him aside, and commanded to bring the other, and said to him, “O you seed of Canaan, and not of Judah, beauty has deceived you, and lust has perverted your heart. Thus you have dealt with the daughters of Israel, and they for fear were intimate with you; but the daughter of Judah would not tolerate your wickedness. Now therefore tell me, under which tree did you take them being intimate together?”

He answered, “Under an evergreen oak tree.”

Then Daniel said to him, “You have also certainly lied against your own head; for the angel of God waits with the sword to cut you in two, that he may destroy you.”

With that, all the assembly cried out with a loud voice, and blessed God, who saves those who hope in him. Then they arose against the two elders, for Daniel had convicted them of false testimony out of their own mouth. According to the law of Moses they did to them what they maliciously intended to do to their neighbor. They put them to death, and the innocent blood was saved the same day. Therefore Helkias and his wife praised God for their daughter Susanna, with Joakim her husband, and all the kindred, because there was no dishonesty found in her. And from that day forth, Daniel had a great reputation in the sight of the people.

### Chapter 14

Bel and the Dragon

King Astyages was gathered to his fathers, and Cyrus the Persian received his kingdom. Daniel lived with the king, and was honored above all his friends.

Now the Babylonians had an idol called Bel, and every day twelve great measures of fine flour, forty sheep, and six firkins of wine were spent on it. The king honored it and went daily to worship it; but Daniel worshiped his own God. The king said to him, “Why don’t you worship Bel?”

He said, “Because I may not honor idols made with hands, but only the living God, who has created the sky and the earth, and has sovereignty over all flesh.”

Then the king said to him, “Don’t you think that Bel is a living god? Don’t you see how much he eats and drinks every day?”

Then Daniel laughed, and said, “O king, don’t be deceived; for this is just clay inside, and brass outside, and never ate or drank anything.”

So the king was angry, and called for his priests, and said to them, “If you don’t tell me who this is who devours these expenses, you shall die. But if you can show me that Bel devours them, then Daniel shall die; for he has spoken blasphemy against Bel.”

Daniel said to the king, “Let it be according to your word.”

Now there were seventy priests of Bel, besides their wives and children. The king went with Daniel into Bel’s temple. So Bel’s priests said, “Behold, we will leave; but you, O king, set out the food, and mix the wine and set it out, shut the door securely, and seal it with your own signet. When you come in the morning, if you don’t find that Bel has eaten everything, we will suffer death, or else Daniel, who speaks falsely against us.”

They weren’t concerned, for under the table they had made a secret entrance, by which they entered in continually, and consumed those things. It happened, when they had gone out, the king set the food before Bel. Now Daniel had commanded his servants to bring ashes, and they scattered them all over the temple in the presence of the king alone. Then they went out, shut the door, sealed it with the king’s signet, and so departed.

Now in the night, the priests came with their wives and children, as they usually did, and ate and drank it all. In the morning, the king arose, and Daniel with him. The king said, “Daniel, are the seals whole?”

He said, “Yes, O king, they are whole.”

And as soon as he had opened the door, the king looked at the table, and cried with a loud voice, “You are great, O Bel, and with you is no deceit at all!”

Then Daniel laughed, and held the king that he should not go in, and said, “Behold now the pavement, and mark well whose footsteps these are.”

The king said, “I see the footsteps of men, women, and children.” Then the king was angry, and took the priests with their wives and children, who showed him the secret doors, where they came in and consumed the things that were on the table. Therefore the king killed them, and delivered Bel into Daniel’s power, who overthrew it and its temple.

In that same place there was a great dragon which the people of Babylon worshiped. The king said to Daniel, “Will you also say that this is of brass? Behold, he lives, eats and drinks. You can’t say that he is no living god. Therefore worship him.”

Then Daniel said, “I will worship the Lord my God; for he is a living God. But allow me, O king, and I will kill this dragon without sword or staff.”

The king said, “I allow you.”

Then Daniel took pitch, fat, and hair, and melted them together, and made lumps of them. He put these in the dragon’s mouth, so the dragon ate and burst apart. Daniel said, “Behold, these are the gods you all worship.”

When the people of Babylon heard that, they took great indignation, and conspired against the king, saying, “The king has become a Jew. He has pulled down Bel, slain the dragon, and put the priests to the sword.” So they came to the king, and said, “Deliver Daniel to us, or else we will destroy you and your house.”

Now when the king saw that they trapped him, being constrained, the king delivered Daniel to them. They cast him into the lion’s den, where he was six days. There were seven lions in the den, and they had been giving them two carcasses and two sheep every day, which then were not given to them, intending that they would devour Daniel.

Now there was in Jewry the prophet Habakkuk, who had made stew, and had broken bread into a bowl. He was going into the field to bring it to the reapers. But the angel of the Lord said to Habakkuk, “Go carry the dinner that you have into Babylon to Daniel, in the lions’ den.”

Habakkuk said, “Lord, I never saw Babylon. I don’t know where the den is.”

Then the angel of the Lord took him by the crown, and lifted him up by the hair of his head, and with the blast of his breath set him in Babylon over the den.

Habakkuk cried, saying, “O Daniel, Daniel, take the dinner which God has sent you.”

Daniel said, “You have remembered me, O God! You haven’t forsaken those who love you!” So Daniel arose and ate; and the angel of God set Habakkuk in his own place again immediately. On the seventh day, the king came to mourn for Daniel. When he came to the den, he looked in, and, behold, Daniel was sitting. Then the king cried with a loud voice, saying, “Great are you, O Lord, you God of Daniel, and there is none other beside you!” So he drew him out, and cast those that were the cause of his destruction into the den; and they were devoured in a moment before his face.

## Wisdom of Solomon

The Wisdom of Solomon is recognized as Deuterocanonical Scripture by the Roman Catholic, Greek Orthodox, and Russian Orthodox Churches.

### Chapter 1

Love righteousness, all you who are judges of the earth.

Think of the Lord with a good mind.

Seek him in singleness of heart,

because he is found by those who don’t put him to the test,

and is manifested to those who trust him.

for crooked thoughts separate from God.

His Power convicts when it is tested,

and exposes the foolish;

because wisdom will not enter into a soul that devises evil,

nor dwell in a body that is enslaved by sin.

For a holy spirit of discipline will flee deceit,

and will depart from thoughts that are without understanding,

and will be ashamed when unrighteousness has come in.

For wisdom is a spirit who loves man,

and she will not hold a blasphemer guiltless for his lips,

because God is witness of his inmost self,

and is a true overseer of his heart,

and a hearer of his tongue.

Because the spirit of the Lord has filled the world,

and that which holds all things together knows what is said.

Therefore no one who utters unrighteous things will be unseen;

neither will Justice, when it convicts, pass him by.

For in his counsels the ungodly will be searched out,

and the sound of his words will come to the Lord to bring his lawless deeds to conviction;

because a jealous ear listens to all things,

and the noise of murmurings is not hidden.

Beware then of unprofitable murmuring,

and keep your tongue from slander;

because no secret utterance will go on its way void,

and a lying mouth destroys a soul.

Don’t court death in the error of your life.

Don’t draw destruction upon yourselves by the works of your hands;

because God didn’t make death,

neither does he delight when the living perish.

For he created all things that they might have being.

The generative powers of the world are wholesome,

and there is no poison of destruction in them,

nor has Hades royal dominion upon earth;

for righteousness is immortal,

but ungodly men by their hands and their words summon death;

deeming him a friend they pined away.

They made a covenant with him,

because they are worthy to belong with him.

### Chapter 2

For they said within themselves, with unsound reasoning,

“Our life is short and sorrowful.

There is no healing when a man comes to his end,

and no one was ever known who was released from Hades.

Because we were born by mere chance,

and hereafter we will be as though we had never been,

because the breath in our nostrils is smoke,

and reason is a spark kindled by the beating of our heart,

which being extinguished, the body will be turned into ashes,

and the spirit will be dispersed as thin air.

Our name will be forgotten in time.

No one will remember our works.

Our life will pass away as the traces of a cloud,

and will be scattered as is a mist,

when it is chased by the rays of the sun,

and overcome by its heat.

For our allotted time is the passing of a shadow,

and our end doesn’t retreat,

because it is securely sealed, and no one turns it back.

“Come therefore and let’s enjoy the good things that exist.

Let’s use the creation earnestly as in our youth.

Let’s fill ourselves with costly wine and perfumes,

and let no spring flower pass us by.

Let’s crown ourselves with rosebuds before they wither.

Let none of us go without his share in our proud revelry.

Let’s leave tokens of mirth everywhere,

because this is our portion, and this is our lot.

Let’s oppress the righteous poor.

Let’s not spare the widow,

nor regard the gray hair of the old man.

But let our strength be a law of righteousness;

for that which is weak is proven useless.

But let’s lie in wait for the righteous man,

because he annoys us,

is contrary to our works,

reproaches us with sins against the law,

and charges us with sins against our training.

He professes to have knowledge of God,

and calls himself a child of the Lord.

He became to us a reproof of our thoughts.

He is grievous to us even to look at,

because his life is unlike other men’s,

and his paths are strange.

We were regarded by him as something worthless,

and he abstains from our ways as from uncleanness.

He calls the latter end of the righteous happy.

He boasts that God is his father.

Let’s see if his words are true.

Let’s test what will happen at the end of his life.

For if the righteous man is God’s son, he will uphold him,

and he will deliver him out of the hand of his adversaries.

Let’s test him with insult and torture,

that we may find out how gentle he is,

and test his patience.

Let’s condemn him to a shameful death,

for he will be protected, according to his words.”

Thus they reasoned, and they were led astray;

for their wickedness blinded them,

and they didn’t know the mysteries of God,

neither did they hope for wages of holiness,

nor did they discern that there is a prize for blameless souls.

Because God created man for incorruption,

and made him an image of his own everlastingness;

but death entered into the world by the envy of the devil,

and those who belong to him experience it.

### Chapter 3

But the souls of the righteous are in the hand of God,

and no torment will touch them.

In the eyes of the foolish they seemed to have died.

Their departure was considered a disaster,

and their travel away from us ruin,

but they are in peace.

For even if in the sight of men they are punished,

their hope is full of immortality.

Having borne a little chastening, they will receive great good;

because God tested them, and found them worthy of himself.

He tested them like gold in the furnace,

and he accepted them as a whole burnt offering.

In the time of their visitation they will shine.

They will run back and forth like sparks among stubble.

They will judge nations and have dominion over peoples.

The Lord will reign over them forever.

Those who trust him will understand truth.

The faithful will live with him in love,

because grace and mercy are with his chosen ones.

But the ungodly will be punished even as their reasoning deserves,

those who neglected righteousness and revolted from the Lord;

for he who despises wisdom and discipline is miserable.

Their hope is void and their toils unprofitable.

Their works are useless.

Their wives are foolish and their children are wicked.

Their descendants are cursed.

For the barren woman who is undefiled is happy,

she who has not conceived in transgression.

She will have fruit when God examines souls.

So is the eunuch which has done no lawless deed with his hands,

nor imagined wicked things against the Lord;

for a precious gift will be given to him for his faithfulness,

and a delightful inheritance in the Lord’s sanctuary.

For good labors have fruit of great renown.

The root of understanding can’t fail.

But children of adulterers will not come to maturity.

The seed of an unlawful union will vanish away.

For if they live long, they will not be esteemed,

and in the end, their old age will be without honor.

If they die young, they will have no hope,

nor consolation in the day of judgment.

For the end of an unrighteous generation is always grievous.

### Chapter 4

It is better to be childless with virtue,

for immortality is in the memory of virtue,

because it is recognized both before God and before men.

When it is present, people imitate it.

They long after it when it has departed.

Throughout all time it marches, crowned in triumph,

victorious in the competition for the prizes that are undefiled.

But the multiplying brood of the ungodly will be of no profit,

and their illegitimate offshoots won’t take deep root,

nor will they establish a sure hold.

For even if they grow branches and flourish for a season,

standing unsure, they will be shaken by the wind.

They will be uprooted by the violence of winds.

Their branches will be broken off before they come to maturity.

Their fruit will be useless,

never ripe to eat, and fit for nothing.

For unlawfully conceived children are witnesses of wickedness

against parents when they are investigated.

But a righteous man, even if he dies before his time, will be at rest.

For honorable old age is not that which stands in length of time,

nor is its measure given by number of years,

but understanding is gray hair to men,

and an unspotted life is ripe old age.

Being found well-pleasing to God, someone was loved.

While living among sinners he was transported.

He was caught away, lest evil should change his understanding,

or guile deceive his soul.

For the fascination of wickedness obscures the things which are good,

and the whirl of desire perverts an innocent mind.

Being made perfect quickly,

he filled a long time;

for his soul was pleasing to the Lord.

Therefore he hurried out of the midst of wickedness.

But the peoples saw and didn’t understand,

not considering this, that grace and mercy are with his chosen,

and that he visits his holy ones;

but a righteous man who is dead will condemn the ungodly who are living,

and youth who is quickly perfected will condemn the many years of an unrighteous man’s old age.

For the ungodly will see a wise man’s end,

and won’t understand what the Lord planned for him,

and why he safely kept him.

They will see, and they will despise;

but the Lord will laugh them to scorn.

After this, they will become a dishonored carcass

and a reproach among the dead forever;

because he will dash them speechless to the ground,

and will shake them from the foundations.

They will lie utterly waste.

They will be in anguish

and their memory will perish.

They will come with coward fear when their sins are counted.

Their lawless deeds will convict them to their face.

### Chapter 5

Then the righteous man will stand in great boldness

before the face of those who afflicted him,

and those who make his labors of no account.

When they see him, they will be troubled with terrible fear,

and will be amazed at the marvel of salvation.

They will speak among themselves repenting,

and for distress of spirit they will groan,

“This was he whom we used to hold in derision,

as a parable of reproach.

We fools considered his life madness,

and his end without honor.

How was he counted among sons of God?

How is his lot among saints?

Truly we went astray from the way of truth.

The light of righteousness didn’t shine for us.

The sun didn’t rise for us.

We took our fill of the paths of lawlessness and destruction.

We traveled through trackless deserts,

but we didn’t know the Lord’s way.

What did our arrogance profit us?

What good have riches and boasting brought us?

Those things all passed away as a shadow,

like a rumor that runs by,

like a ship passing through the billowy water,

which, when it has gone by, there is no trace to be found,

no pathway of its keel in the waves.

Or it is like when a bird flies through the air,

no evidence of its passage is found,

but the light wind, lashed with the stroke of its pinions,

and torn apart with the violent rush of the moving wings, is passed through.

Afterwards no sign of its coming remains.

Or it is like when an arrow is shot at a mark,

the air it divided closes up again immediately,

so that men don’t know where it passed through.

So we also, as soon as we were born, ceased to be;

and we had no sign of virtue to show,

but we were utterly consumed in our wickedness.”

Because the hope of the ungodly man is like chaff carried by the wind,

and as foam vanishing before a tempest;

and is scattered like smoke by the wind,

and passes by as the remembrance of a guest who stays just a day.

But the righteous live forever.

Their reward is in the Lord,

and the care for them with the Most High.

Therefore they will receive the crown of royal dignity

and the diadem of beauty from the Lord’s hand,

because he will cover them with his right hand,

and he will shield them with his arm.

He will take his zeal as complete armor,

and will make the whole creation his weapons to punish his enemies:

He will put on righteousness as a breastplate,

and will wear impartial judgment as a helmet.

He will take holiness as an invincible shield.

He will sharpen stern wrath for a sword.

The universe will go with him to fight against his frenzied foes.

Shafts of lightning will fly with true aim.

They will leap to the mark from the clouds, as from a well-drawn bow.

Hailstones full of wrath will be hurled as from a catapult.

The water of the sea will be angered against them.

Rivers will sternly overwhelm them.

A mighty wind will encounter them.

It will winnow them away like a tempest.

So lawlessness will make all the land desolate.

Their evil-doing will overturn the thrones of princes.

### Chapter 6

Hear therefore, you kings, and understand.

Learn, you judges of the ends of the earth.

Give ear, you rulers who have dominion over many people,

and make your boast in multitudes of nations,

because your dominion was given to you from the Lord,

and your sovereignty from the Most High.

He will search out your works,

and will inquire about your plans,

because being officers of his kingdom, you didn’t judge rightly,

nor did you keep the law,

nor did you walk according to God’s counsel.

He will come upon you awfully and swiftly,

because a stern judgment comes on those who are in high places.

For the man of low estate may be pardoned in mercy,

but mighty men will be mightily tested.

For the Sovereign Lord of all will not be impressed with anyone,

neither will he show deference to greatness;

because it is he who made both small and great,

and cares about them all;

but the scrutiny that comes upon the powerful is strict.

Therefore, my words are to you, O princes,

that you may learn wisdom and not fall away.

For those who have kept the things that are holy in holiness will be made holy.

Those who have been taught them will find what to say in defense.

Therefore set your desire on my words.

Long for them, and you princes will be instructed.

Wisdom is radiant and doesn’t fade away;

and is easily seen by those who love her,

and found by those who seek her.

She anticipates those who desire her, making herself known.

He who rises up early to seek her won’t have difficulty,

for he will find her sitting at his gates.

For to think upon her is perfection of understanding,

and he who watches for her will quickly be free from care;

because she herself goes around, seeking those who are worthy of her,

and in their paths she appears to them graciously,

and in every purpose she meets them.

For her true beginning is desire for instruction;

and desire for instruction is love.

And love is observance of her laws.

To give heed to her laws confirms immortality.

Immortality brings closeness to God.

So then desire for wisdom promotes to a kingdom.

If therefore you delight in thrones and sceptres, you princes of peoples,

honor wisdom, that you may reign forever.

But what wisdom is, and how she came into being, I will declare.

I won’t hide mysteries from you;

but I will explore from her first beginning,

bring the knowledge of her into clear light,

and I will not pass by the truth.

Indeed, I won’t travel with consuming envy,

because envy will have no fellowship with wisdom.

But a multitude of wise men is salvation to the world,

and an understanding king is stability for his people.

Therefore be instructed by my words, and you will profit.

### Chapter 7

I myself am also mortal, like everyone else,

and am a descendant of one formed first and born of the earth.

I molded into flesh in the time of ten months in my mother’s womb,

being compacted in blood from the seed of man and pleasure of marriage.

I also, when I was born, drew in the common air,

and fell upon the kindred earth,

uttering, like all, for my first voice, the same cry.

I was nursed with care in swaddling clothes.

For no king had a different beginning,

but all men have one entrance into life, and a common departure.

For this cause I prayed, and understanding was given to me.

I asked, and a spirit of wisdom came to me.

I preferred her before sceptres and thrones.

I considered riches nothing in comparison to her.

Neither did I liken to her any priceless gem,

because all gold in her presence is a little sand,

and silver will be considered as clay before her.

I loved her more than health and beauty,

and I chose to have her rather than light,

because her bright shining is never laid to sleep.

All good things came to me with her,

and innumerable riches are in her hands.

And I rejoiced over them all because wisdom leads them;

although I didn’t know that she was their mother.

As I learned without guile, I impart without grudging.

I don’t hide her riches.

For she is a treasure for men that doesn’t fail,

and those who use it obtain friendship with God,

commended by the gifts which they present through discipline.

But may God grant that I may speak his judgment,

and to conceive thoughts worthy of what has been given me;

because he is one who guides even wisdom and who corrects the wise.

For both we and our words are in his hand,

with all understanding and skill in various crafts.

For he himself gave me an unerring knowledge of the things that are,

to know the structure of the universe and the operation of the elements;

the beginning, end, and middle of times;

the alternations of the solstices and the changes of seasons;

the circuits of years and the positions of stars;

the natures of living creatures and the raging of wild beasts;

the violence of winds and the thoughts of men;

the diversities of plants and the virtues of roots.

All things that are either secret or manifest I learned,

for wisdom, that is the architect of all things, taught me.

For there is in her a spirit that is quick to understand, holy,

unique, manifold, subtle, freely moving, clear in utterance, unpolluted,

distinct, invulnerable, loving what is good, keen, unhindered,

beneficent, loving toward man, steadfast, sure, free from care, all-powerful, all-surveying,

and penetrating through all spirits that are quick to understand, pure, most subtle.

For wisdom is more mobile than any motion.

Yes, she pervades and penetrates all things by reason of her purity.

For she is a breath of the power of God,

and a pure emanation of the glory of the Almighty.

Therefore nothing defiled can find entrance into her.

For she is a reflection of everlasting light,

an unspotted mirror of the working of God,

and an image of his goodness.

Although she is one, she has power to do all things.

Remaining in herself, she renews all things.

From generation to generation passing into holy souls,

she makes friends of God and prophets.

For God loves nothing as much as one who dwells with wisdom.

For she is fairer than the sun,

and above all the constellations of the stars.

She is better than light.

For daylight yields to night,

but evil does not prevail against wisdom.

### Chapter 8

But she reaches from one end to the other with full strength,

and orders all things well.

I loved her and sought her from my youth.

I sought to take her for my bride.

I became enamoured by her beauty.

She glorifies her noble birth by living with God.

The Sovereign Lord of all loves her.

For she is initiated into the knowledge of God,

and she chooses his works.

But if riches are a desired possession in life,

what is richer than wisdom, which makes all things?

And if understanding is effective,

who more than wisdom is an architect of the things that exist?

If a man loves righteousness,

the fruits of wisdom’s labor are virtues,

for she teaches soberness, understanding, righteousness, and courage.

There is nothing in life more profitable for people than these.

And if anyone longs for wide experience,

she knows the things of old, and infers the things to come.

She understands subtleties of speeches and interpretations of dark sayings.

She foresees signs and wonders, and the issues of seasons and times.

Therefore I determined to take her to live with me,

knowing that she is one who would give me good counsel,

and encourage me in cares and grief.

Because of her, I will have glory among multitudes,

and honor in the sight of elders, though I am young.

I will be found keen when I give judgment.

I will be admired in the presence of rulers.

When I am silent, they will wait for me.

When I open my lips, they will heed what I say.

If I continue speaking, they will put their hands on their mouths.

Because of her, I will have immortality,

and leave behind an eternal memory to those who come after me.

I will govern peoples.

Nations will be subjected to me.

Dreaded monarchs will fear me when they hear of me.

Among the people, I will show myself to be good, and courageous in war.

When I come into my house, I will find rest with her.

For conversation with her has no bitterness,

and living with her has no pain, but gladness and joy.

When I considered these things in myself,

and thought in my heart how immortality is in kinship to wisdom,

and in her friendship is good delight,

and in the labors of her hands is wealth that doesn’t fail,

and understanding is in her companionship,

and great renown in having fellowship with her words,

I went about seeking how to take her to myself.

Now I was a clever child, and received a good soul.

Or rather, being good, I came into an undefiled body.

But perceiving that I could not otherwise possess wisdom unless God gave her to me—

yes, and to know and understand by whom the grace is given—

I pleaded with the Lord and implored him, and with my whole heart I said:

### Chapter 9

“O God of my ancestors and Lord of mercy,

who made all things by your word;

and by your wisdom you formed man,

that he should have dominion over the creatures that were made by you,

and rule the world in holiness and righteousness,

and execute judgment in uprightness of soul,

give me wisdom, her who sits by you on your thrones.

Don’t reject me from among your servants,

because I am your servant and the son of your handmaid,

a weak and short-lived man,

with little power to understand judgment and laws.

For even if a man is perfect among the sons of men,

if the wisdom that comes from you is not with him, he will count for nothing.

You chose me to be king of your people,

and a judge for your sons and daughters.

You gave a command to build a sanctuary on your holy mountain,

and an altar in the city where you live,

a copy of the holy tent which you prepared from the beginning.

Wisdom is with you and knows your works,

and was present when you were making the world,

and understands what is pleasing in your eyes,

and what is right according to your commandments.

Send her from the holy heavens,

and ask her to come from the throne of your glory,

that being present with me she may work,

and I may learn what pleases you well.

For she knows all things and understands,

and she will guide me prudently in my actions.

She will guard me in her glory.

So my works will be acceptible.

I will judge your people righteously,

and I will be worthy of my father’s throne.

For what man will know the counsel of God?

Or who will conceive what the Lord wills?

For the thoughts of mortals are unstable,

and our plans are prone to fail.

For a corruptible body weighs down the soul.

The earthy tent burdens a mind that is full of cares.

We can hardly guess the things that are on earth,

and we find the things that are close at hand with labor;

but who has traced out the things that are in the heavens?

Who gained knowledge of your counsel, unless you gave wisdom,

and sent your holy spirit from on high?

It was thus that the ways of those who are on earth were corrected,

and men were taught the things that are pleasing to you.

They were saved through wisdom.”

### Chapter 10

Wisdom guarded to the end the first formed father of the world, who was created alone,

and delivered him out of his own transgression,

and gave him strength to rule over all things.

But when an unrighteous man fell away from her in his anger,

he perished himself in the rage with which he killed his brother.

When for his cause the earth was drowning with a flood,

wisdom again saved it,

guiding the righteous man’s course by a paltry piece of wood.

Moreover, when nations consenting together in wickedness had been confounded,

wisdom knew the righteous man, and preserved him blameless to God,

and kept him strong when his heart yearned toward his child.

While the ungodly were perishing, wisdom delivered a righteous man,

when he fled from the fire that descended out of heaven on the five cities.

To whose wickedness a smoking waste still witnesses,

and plants bearing fair fruit that doesn’t ripen,

a disbelieving soul has a memorial: a standing pillar of salt.

For having passed wisdom by,

not only were they disabled from recognising the things which are good,

but they also left behind them for their life a monument of their folly,

to the end that where they stumbled, they might fail even to be unseen;

but wisdom delivered those who waited on her out of troubles.

When a righteous man was a fugitive from a brother’s wrath, wisdom guided him in straight paths.

She showed him God’s kingdom, and gave him knowledge of holy things.

She prospered him in his toils, and multiplied the fruits of his labor.

When in their covetousness men dealt harshly with him,

she stood by him and made him rich.

She guarded him from enemies,

and she kept him safe from those who lay in wait.

Over his severe conflict, she watched as judge,

that he might know that godliness is more powerful than every one.

When a righteous man was sold, wisdom didn’t forsake him,

but she delivered him from sin.

She went down with him into a dungeon,

and in bonds she didn’t depart from him,

until she brought him the sceptre of a kingdom,

and authority over those that dealt like a tyrant with him.

She also showed those who had mockingly accused him to be false,

and gave him eternal glory.

Wisdom delivered a holy people and a blameless seed from a nation of oppressors.

She entered into the soul of a servant of the Lord,

and withstood terrible kings in wonders and signs.

She rendered to holy men a reward of their toils.

She guided them along a marvelous way,

and became to them a covering in the day-time,

and a starry flame through the night.

She brought them over the Red sea,

and led them through much water;

but she drowned their enemies,

and she cast them up from the bottom of the deep.

Therefore the righteous plundered the ungodly,

and they sang praise to your holy name, O Lord,

and extolled with one accord your hand that fought for them,

because wisdom opened the mouth of the mute,

and made the tongues of babes to speak clearly.

### Chapter 11

Wisdom prospered their works in the hand of a holy prophet.

They traveled through a desert without inhabitant,

and they pitched their tents in trackless regions.

They withstood enemies and repelled foes.

They thirsted, and they called upon you,

and water was given to them out of the flinty rock,

and healing of their thirst out of the hard stone.

For by what things their foes were punished,

by these they in their need were benefited.

When enemies were troubled with clotted blood

instead of a river’s ever-flowing fountain,

to rebuke the decree for the slaying of babies,

you gave them abundant water beyond all hope,

having shown by the thirst which they had suffered

how you punished the adversaries.

For when they were tried, although chastened in mercy,

they learned how the ungodly were tormented, being judged with wrath.

For you tested these as a father admonishing them;

but you searched out those as a stern king condemning them.

Yes and whether they were far off or near,

they were equally distressed;

for a double grief seized them,

and a groaning at the memory of things past.

For when they heard that through their own punishments the others benefited,

they recognized the Lord.

For him who long before was thrown out and exposed they stopped mocking.

In the end of what happened, they marveled,

having thirsted in another manner than the righteous.

But in return for the senseless imaginings of their unrighteousness,

wherein they were led astray to worship irrational reptiles and wretched vermin,

you sent upon them a multitude of irrational creatures to punish them,

that they might learn that by what things a man sins, by these he is punished.

For your all-powerful hand

that created the world out of formless matter

didn’t lack means to send upon them a multitude of bears, fierce lions,

or newly-created and unknown wild beasts, full of rage,

either breathing out a blast of fiery breath,

or belching out smoke,

or flashing dreadful sparks from their eyes;

which had power not only to consume them by their violence,

but to destroy them even by the terror of their sight.

Yes and without these they might have fallen by a single breath,

being pursued by Justice, and scattered abroad by the breath of your power;

but you arranged all things by measure, number, and weight.

For to be greatly strong is yours at all times.

Who could withstand the might of your arm?

Because the whole world before you is as a grain in a balance,

and as a drop of dew that comes down upon the earth in the morning.

But you have mercy on all men, because you have power to do all things,

and you overlook the sins of men to the end that they may repent.

For you love all things that are,

and abhor none of the things which you made;

For you never would have formed anything if you hated it.

How would anything have endured unless you had willed it?

Or that which was not called by you, how would it have been preserved?

But you spare all things, because they are yours,

O Sovereign Lord, you who love the living.

### Chapter 12

For your incorruptible spirit is in all things.

Therefore you convict little by little those who fall from the right way,

and, putting them in remembrance by the things wherein they sin, you admonish them,

that escaping from their wickedness they may believe in you, O Lord.

For truly the old inhabitants of your holy land,

hating them because they practiced detestable works of enchantments and unholy rites—

merciless slaughters of children

and sacrificial banquets of men’s flesh and of blood—

allies in an impious fellowship,

and murderers of their own helpless babes,

it was your counsel to destroy by the hands of our fathers;

that the land which in your sight is most precious of all

might receive a worthy colony of God’s servants.

Nevertheless you even spared these as men,

and you sent hornets as forerunners of your army,

to cause them to perish little by little.

Not that you were unable to subdue the ungodly under the hand of the righteous in battle,

or by terrible beasts or by a stern word to make away with them at once,

but judging them little by little you gave them a chance to repent,

not being ignorant that their nature by birth was evil,

their wickedness inborn,

and that their manner of thought would never be changed.

For they were a cursed seed from the beginning.

It wasn’t through fear of any that you left them unpunished for their sins.

For who will say, “What have you done?”

Or “Who will withstand your judgment?”

Who will accuse you for the perishing of nations which you caused?

Or who will come and stand before you as an avenger for unrighteous men?

For there isn’t any God beside you that cares for all,

that you might show that you didn’t judge unrighteously.

No king or prince will be able to confront you

about those whom you have punished.

But being righteous, you rule all things righteously,

deeming it a thing alien from your power

to condemn one who doesn’t deserve to be punished.

For your strength is the source of righteousness,

and your sovereignty over all makes you to forbear all.

For when men don’t believe that you are perfect in power, you show your strength,

and in dealing with those who think this, you confuse their boldness.

But you, being sovereign in strength, judge in gentleness,

and with great forbearance you govern us;

for the power is yours whenever you desire it.

But you taught your people by such works as these,

how the righteous must be kind.

You made your sons to have good hope,

because you give repentance when men have sinned.

For if on those who were enemies of your servants and deserving of death,

you took vengeance with so great deliberation and indulgence,

giving them times and opportunities when they might escape from their wickedness,

with how great care you judged your sons,

to whose fathers you gave oaths and covenants of good promises!

Therefore while you chasten us, you scourge our enemies ten thousand times more,

to the intent that we may ponder your goodness when we judge,

and when we are judged may look for mercy.

Therefore also the unrighteous that lived in a life of folly,

you tormented through their own abominations.

For truly they went astray very far in the ways of error,

Taking as gods those animals which even among their enemies were held in dishonor,

deceived like foolish babes.

Therefore, as to unreasoning children, you sent your judgment to mock them.

But those who would not be admonished by mild correction

will experience the deserved judgment of God.

For through the sufferings they were indignant of,

being punished in these creatures which they supposed to be gods,

they saw and recognized as the true God him whom they previously refused to know.

Therefore also the result of extreme condemnation came upon them.

### Chapter 13

For truly all men who had no perception of God were foolish by nature,

and didn’t gain power to know him who exists from the good things that are seen.

They didn’t recognize the architect from his works.

But they thought that either fire, or wind, or swift air,

or circling stars, or raging water, or luminaries of heaven

were gods that rule the world.

If it was through delight in their beauty that they took them to be gods,

let them know how much better their Sovereign Lord is than these,

for the first author of beauty created them.

But if it was through astonishment at their power and influence,

then let them understand from them how much more powerful he who formed them is.

For from the greatness of the beauty of created things,

mankind forms the corresponding perception of their Maker.

But yet for these men there is but small blame,

for they too perhaps go astray

while they are seeking God and desiring to find him.

For they diligently search while living among his works,

and they trust their sight that the things that they look at are beautiful.

But again even they are not to be excused.

For if they had power to know so much,

that they should be able to explore the world,

how is it that they didn’t find the Sovereign Lord sooner?

But they were miserable, and their hopes were in dead things,

who called them gods which are works of men’s hands,

gold and silver, skillfully made, and likenesses of animals,

or a useless stone, the work of an ancient hand.

Yes and some woodcutter might saw down a tree that is easily moved,

skillfully strip away all its bark,

and fashion it in attractive form, make a useful vessel to serve his life’s needs.

Burning the scraps from his handiwork to cook his food,

he eats his fill.

Taking a discarded scrap which served no purpose,

a crooked piece of wood and full of knots,

he carves it with the diligence of his idleness,

and shapes it by the skill of his idleness.

He shapes it in the image of a man,

or makes it like some worthless animal,

smearing it with something red, painting it red,

and smearing over every stain in it.

Having made a worthy chamber for it,

he sets it in a wall, securing it with iron.

He plans for it that it may not fall down,

knowing that it is unable to help itself

(for truly it is an image, and needs help).

When he makes his prayer concerning goods and his marriage and children,

he is not ashamed to speak to that which has no life.

Yes, for health, he calls upon that which is weak.

For life, he implores that which is dead.

For aid, he supplicates that which has no experience.

For a good journey, he asks that which can’t so much as move a step.

And for profit in business and good success of his hands,

he asks ability from that which has hands with no ability.

### Chapter 14

Again, one preparing to sail, and about to journey over raging waves,

calls upon a piece of wood more fragile than the vessel that carries him.

For the hunger for profit planned it,

and wisdom was the craftsman who built it.

Your providence, O Father, guides it along,

because even in the sea you gave a way,

and in the waves a sure path,

showing that you can save out of every danger,

that even a man without skill may put to sea.

It is your will that the works of your wisdom should not be ineffective.

Therefore men also entrust their lives to a little piece of wood,

and passing through the surge on a raft come safely to land.

For in the old time also, when proud giants were perishing,

the hope of the world, taking refuge on a raft,

your hand guided the seed of generations of the race of men.

For blessed is wood through which comes righteousness;

but the idol made with hands is accursed, itself and he that made it;

because his was the working, and the corruptible thing was called a god.

For both the ungodly and his ungodliness are alike hateful to God;

for truly the deed will be punished together with him who committed it.

Therefore also there will be a visitation among the idols of the nation,

because, though formed of things which God created, they were made an abomination,

stumbling blocks to the souls of men,

and a snare to the feet of the foolish.

For the devising of idols was the beginning of fornication,

and the invention of them the corruption of life.

For they didn’t exist from the beginning, and they won’t exist forever.

For by the boastfulness of men they entered into the world,

and therefore a speedy end was planned for them.

For a father worn with untimely grief,

making an image of the child quickly taken away,

now honored him as a god which was then a dead human being,

and delivered to those that were under him mysteries and solemn rites.

Afterward the ungodly custom, in process of time grown strong, was kept as a law,

and the engraved images received worship by the commandments of princes.

And when men could not honor them in presence because they lived far off,

imagining the likeness from afar,

they made a visible image of the king whom they honored,

that by their zeal they might flatter the absent as if present.

But worship was raised to a yet higher pitch, even by those who didn’t know him,

urged forward by the ambition of the architect;

for he, wishing perhaps to please his ruler,

used his art to force the likeness toward a greater beauty.

So the multitude, allured by reason of the grace of his handiwork,

now consider an object of devotion him that a little before was honored as a man.

And this became an ambush,

because men, in bondage either to calamity or to tyranny,

invested stones and stocks with the Name that shouldn’t be shared.

Afterward it was not enough for them to go astray concerning the knowledge of God,

but also, while they live in a great war of ignorance, they call a multitude of evils peace.

For either slaughtering children in solemn rites, or celebrating secret mysteries,

or holding frenzied revels of strange customs,

no longer do they guard either life or purity of marriage,

but one brings upon another either death by treachery, or anguish by adultery.

And all things confusedly are filled with blood and murder, theft and deceit,

corruption, faithlessness, tumult, perjury,

confusion about what is good, forgetfulness of favors,

ingratitude for benefits,

defiling of souls, confusion of sex,

disorder in marriage, adultery and wantonness.

For the worship of idols that may not be named

is a beginning and cause and end of every evil.

For their worshipers either make merry to madness, or prophesy lies,

or live unrighteously, or lightly commit perjury.

For putting their trust in lifeless idols,

when they have sworn a wicked oath, they expect not to suffer harm.

But on both counts, the just doom will pursue them,

because they had evil thoughts of God by giving heed to idols,

and swore unrighteously in deceit through contempt for holiness.

For it is not the power of things by which men swear,

but it is the just penalty for those who sin

that always visits the transgression of the unrighteous.

### Chapter 15

But you, our God, are gracious and true,

patient, and in mercy ordering all things.

For even if we sin, we are yours, knowing your dominion;

but we will not sin, knowing that we have been accounted yours.

For to be acquainted with you is perfect righteousness,

and to know your dominion is the root of immortality.

For we weren’t led astray by any evil plan of men’s,

nor yet by painters’ fruitless labor,

a form stained with varied colors,

the sight of which leads fools into lust.

Their desire is for the breathless form of a dead image.

Lovers of evil things, and worthy of such hopes,

are those who make, desire, and worship them.

For a potter, kneading soft earth,

laboriously molds each article for our service.

He fashions out of the same clay

both the vessels that minister to clean uses, and those of a contrary sort,

all in like manner.

What shall be the use of each article of either sort,

the potter is the judge.

Also, laboring to an evil end, he molds a vain god out of the same clay,

he who, having but a little before been made of earth,

after a short space goes his way to the earth out of which he was taken,

when he is required to render back the soul which was lent him.

However he has anxious care,

not because his powers must fail,

nor because his span of life is short;

But he compares himself with goldsmiths and silversmiths,

and he imitates molders in brass,

and considers it great that he molds counterfeit gods.

His heart is ashes.

His hope is of less value than earth.

His life is of less honor than clay,

because he was ignorant of him who molded him,

and of him that inspired into him an active soul,

and breathed into him a vital spirit.

But he accounted our life to be a game,

and our lifetime a festival for profit;

for, he says, one must get gain however one can, even if it is by evil.

For this man, beyond all others, knows that he sins,

out of earthy matter making brittle vessels and engraved images.

But most foolish and more miserable than a baby,

are the enemies of your people, who oppressed them;

because they even considered all the idols of the nations to be gods,

which have neither the use of eyes for seeing,

nor nostrils for drawing breath,

nor ears to hear,

nor fingers for handling,

and their feet are helpless for walking.

For a man made them,

and one whose own spirit is borrowed molded them;

for no one has power as a man to mold a god like himself.

But, being mortal, he makes a dead thing by the work of lawless hands;

for he is better than the objects of his worship,

since he indeed had life, but they never did.

Yes, and they worship the creatures that are most hateful,

for, being compared as to lack of sense, these are worse than all others;

Neither, as seen beside other creatures, are they beautiful, so that one should desire them,

but they have escaped both the praise of God and his blessing.

### Chapter 16

For this cause, they were deservedly punished through creatures like those which they worship,

and tormented through a multitude of vermin.

Instead of this punishment, you, giving benefits to your people,

prepared quails for food,

a delicacy to satisfy the desire of their appetite,

to the end that your enemies, desiring food,

might for the hideousness of the creatures sent among them,

loathe even the necessary appetite;

but these, your people, having for a short time suffered lack,

might even partake of delicacies.

For it was necessary that inescapable lack should come upon those oppressors,

but that to these it should only be showed how their enemies were tormented.

For even when terrible raging of wild beasts came upon your people,

and they were perishing by the bites of crooked serpents,

your wrath didn’t continue to the uttermost;

but for admonition were they troubled for a short time,

having a token of salvation

to put them in remembrance of the commandment of your law;

for he who turned toward it was not saved because of that which was seen,

but because of you, the Savior of all.

Yes, and in this you persuaded our enemies

that you are he who delivers out of every evil.

For the bites of locusts and flies truly killed them.

No healing for their life was found,

because they were worthy to be punished by such things.

But your children weren’t overcome by the very fangs of venomous dragons,

for your mercy passed by where they were and healed them.

For they were bitten to put them in remembrance of your oracles,

and were quickly saved, lest, falling into deep forgetfulness,

they should become unable to respond to your kindness.

For truly it was neither herb nor poultice that cured them,

but your word, O Lord, which heals all people.

For you have authority over life and death,

and you lead down to the gates of Hades, and lead up again.

But though a man kills by his wickedness,

he can’t retrieve the spirit that has departed

or release the imprisoned soul.

But it is not possible to escape your hand;

for ungodly men, refusing to know you, were scourged in the strength of your arm,

pursued with strange rains and hails and relentless storms,

and utterly consumed with fire.

For, what was most marvelous,

in the water which quenches all things, the fire burned hotter;

for the world fights for the righteous.

For at one time the flame was restrained,

that it might not burn up the creatures sent against the ungodly,

but that these themselves as they looked might see that they were chased by the judgment of God.

At another time even in the midst of water it burns more intensely than fire,

that it may destroy the produce of an unrighteous land.

Instead of these things, you gave your people angels’ food to eat,

and you provided ready-to-eat bread for them from heaven without toil,

having the virtue of every pleasant flavor,

and agreeable to every taste.

For your nature showed your sweetness toward your children,

while that bread, serving the desire of the eater,

changed itself according to every man’s choice.

But snow and ice endured fire, and didn’t melt,

that people might know that fire was destroying the fruits of the enemies,

burning in the hail and flashing in the rains;

and that this fire, again, in order that righteous people may be nourished,

has even forgotten its own power.

For the creation, ministering to you, its maker,

strains its force against the unrighteous for punishment

and in kindness, slackens it on behalf of those who trust in you.

Therefore at that time also, converting itself into all forms,

it ministered to your all-nourishing bounty,

according to the desire of those who had need,

that your children, whom you loved, O Lord, might learn

that it is not the growth of crops that nourishes a man,

but that your word preserves those who trust you.

For that which was not destroyed by fire,

melted away when it was simply warmed by a faint sunbeam,

that it might be known that we must rise before the sun to give you thanks,

and must pray to you at the dawning of the light;

for the hope of the unthankful will melt as the winter’s hoar frost,

and will flow away as water that has no use.

### Chapter 17

For your judgments are great, and hard to interpret;

therefore undisciplined souls went astray.

For when lawless men had supposed that they held a holy nation in their power,

they, prisoners of darkness, and bound in the fetters of a long night,

kept close beneath their roofs,

lay exiled from the eternal providence.

For while they thought that they were unseen in their secret sins,

they were divided from one another by a dark curtain of forgetfulness,

stricken with terrible awe, and very troubled by apparitions.

For neither did the dark recesses that held them guard them from fears,

but terrifying sounds rang around them,

and dismal phantoms appeared with unsmiling faces.

And no power of fire prevailed to give light,

neither were the brightest flames of the stars strong enough to illuminate that gloomy night;

but only the glimmering of a self-kindled fire appeared to them, full of fear.

In terror, they considered the things which they saw

to be worse than that sight, on which they could not gaze.

The mockeries of their magic arts were powerless, now,

and a shameful rebuke of their boasted understanding:

For those who promised to drive away terrors and disorders from a sick soul,

these were sick with a ludicrous fearfulness.

For even if no troubling thing frighted them,

yet, scared with the creeping of vermin and hissing of serpents,

they perished trembling in fear,

refusing even to look at the air, which could not be escaped on any side.

For wickedness, condemned by a witness within, is a coward thing,

and, being pressed hard by conscience, always has added forecasts of the worst.

For fear is nothing else but a surrender of the help which reason offers;

and from within, the expectation of being less

prefers ignorance of the cause that brings the torment.

But they, all through the night which was powerless indeed,

and which came upon them out of the recesses of powerless Hades,

sleeping the same sleep,

now were haunted by monstrous apparitions,

and now were paralyzed by their soul’s surrendering;

for sudden and unexpected fear came upon them.

So then whoever it might be, sinking down in his place,

was kept captive, shut up in that prison which was not barred with iron;

for whether he was a farmer, or a shepherd,

or a laborer whose toils were in the wilderness,

he was overtaken, and endured that inescapable sentence;

for they were all bound with one chain of darkness.

Whether there was a whistling wind,

or a melodious sound of birds among the spreading branches,

or a measured fall of water running violently,

or a harsh crashing of rocks hurled down,

or the swift course of animals bounding along unseen,

or the voice of wild beasts harshly roaring,

or an echo rebounding from the hollows of the mountains,

all these things paralyzed them with terror.

For the whole world was illuminated with clear light,

and was occupied with unhindered works,

while over them alone was spread a heavy night,

an image of the darkness that should afterward receive them;

but to themselves, they were heavier than darkness.

### Chapter 18

But for your holy ones there was great light.

Their enemies, hearing their voice but not seeing their form,

counted it a happy thing that they too had suffered,

yet for that they do not hurt them, though wronged by them before, they are thankful;

and because they had been at variance with them, they begged for pardon.

Therefore you provided a burning pillar of fire,

to be a guide for your people’s unknown journey,

and a harmless sun for their glorious exile.

For the Egyptians well deserved to be deprived of light and imprisoned by darkness,

they who had imprisoned your children,

through whom the incorruptible light of the law was to be given to the race of men.

After they had taken counsel to kill the babes of the holy ones,

and when a single child had been abandoned and saved to convict them of their sin,

you took away from them their multitude of children,

and destroyed all their army together in a mighty flood.

Our fathers were made aware of that night beforehand,

that, having sure knowledge, they might be cheered by the oaths which they had trusted.

Salvation of the righteous and destruction of the enemies was expected by your people.

For as you took vengeance on the adversaries,

by the same means, calling us to yourself, you glorified us.

For holy children of good men offered sacrifice in secret,

and with one consent they agreed to the covenant of the divine law,

that they would partake alike in the same good things and the same perils,

the fathers already leading the sacred songs of praise.

But the discordant cry of the enemies echoed back,

and a pitiful voice of lamentation for children was spread abroad.

Both servant and master were punished with the same just doom,

and the commoner suffering the same as king;

Yes, they all together, under one form of death,

had corpses without number.

For the living were not sufficient even to bury them,

Since at a single stroke, their most cherished offspring was consumed.

For while they were disbelieving all things by reason of the enchantments,

upon the destruction of the firstborn they confessed the people to be God’s children.

For while peaceful silence wrapped all things,

and night in her own swiftness was half spent,

your all-powerful word leaped from heaven, from the royal throne,

a stern warrior, into the midst of the doomed land,

bearing as a sharp sword your authentic commandment,

and standing, it filled all things with death,

and while it touched the heaven it stood upon the earth.

Then immediately apparitions in dreams terribly troubled them,

and unexpected fears came upon them.

And each, one thrown here half dead, another there,

made known why he was dying;

for the dreams, disturbing them, forewarned them of this,

that they might not perish without knowing why they were afflicted.

The experience of death also touched the righteous,

and a multitude were destroyed in the wilderness,

but the wrath didn’t last long.

For a blameless man hurried to be their champion,

bringing the weapon of his own ministry,

prayer, and the atoning sacrifice of incense.

He withstood the indignation and set an end to the calamity,

showing that he was your servant.

And he overcame the anger,

not by strength of body, not by force of weapons,

but by his word, he subdued the avenger

by bringing to remembrance oaths and covenants made with the fathers.

For when the dead had already fallen in heaps one upon another,

he intervened and stopped the wrath,

and cut off its way to the living.

For the whole world was pictured on his long robe,

and the glories of the fathers were upon the engraving of the four rows of precious stones,

and your majesty was upon the diadem on his head.

The destroyer yielded to these, and they feared;

for it was enough only to test the wrath.

### Chapter 19

But indignation without mercy came upon the ungodly to the end;

for God also foreknew their future,

how, having changed their minds to let your people go,

and having sped them eagerly on their way,

they would change their minds and pursue them.

For while they were yet in the midst of their mourning,

and lamenting at the graves of the dead,

they made another foolish decision,

and pursued as fugitives those whom they had begged to leave and driven out.

For the doom which they deserved was drawing them to this end,

and it made them forget the things that had happened to them,

that they might fill up the punishment which was yet lacking from their torments,

and that your people might journey on by a marvelous road,

but they themselves might find a strange death.

For the whole creation, each part in its diverse kind, was made new again,

complying with your commandments,

that your servants might be kept unharmed.

Then the cloud that overshadowed the camp was seen,

and dry land rising up out of what had been water,

out of the Red sea an unhindered highway,

and a grassy plain out of the violent surge,

by which they passed over with all their army,

these who were covered with your hand,

having seen strange marvels.

For like horses they roamed at large,

and they skipped about like lambs,

praising you, O Lord, who was their deliverer.

For they still remembered the things that happened in the time of their sojourning,

how instead of bearing cattle, the land brought forth lice,

and instead of fish, the river spewed out a multitude of frogs.

But afterwards, they also saw a new kind of birds,

when, led on by desire, they asked for luxurious dainties;

for, to comfort them, quails came up for them from the sea.

Punishments came upon the sinners,

not without the signs that were given beforehand by the violence of the thunder,

for they justly suffered through their own wickednesses,

for the hatred which they practiced toward guests was grievous indeed.

For while the others didn’t receive the strangers when they came to them,

the Egyptians made slaves of guests who were their benefactors.

And not only so, but while punishment of some sort will come upon the former,

since they received as enemies those who were aliens;

because these first welcomed with feastings,

and then afflicted with dreadful toils,

those who had already shared with them in the same rights.

And moreover they were stricken with loss of sight

(even as were those others at the righteous man’s doors),

when, being surrounded with yawning darkness,

they each looked for the passage through his own door.

For as the notes of a lute vary the character of the rhythm,

even so the elements, changing their order one with another,

continuing always in its sound,

as may clearly be conjectured from the sight of the things that have happened.

For creatures of the dry land were turned into creatures of the waters,

and creatures that swim moved upon the land.

Fire kept the mastery of its own power in water,

and water forgot its quenching nature.

On the contrary, flames didn’t consume flesh of perishable creatures that walked among them,

neither did they melt the crystalline grains of ambrosial food that were melted easily.

For in all things, O Lord, you magnified your people,

and you glorified them and didn’t lightly regard them,

standing by their side in every time and place.

## Sirach

The Wisdom of Jesus the Son of Sirach, also called Ecclesiasticus, is recognized as Deuterocanonical Scripture by the Roman Catholic, Greek Orthodox, and Russian Orthodox Churches.

### The Prologue of the Wisdom of Jesus the Son of Sirach.

WHEREAS many and great things have been delivered to us by the law and the prophets, and by the others that have followed in their steps, for which we must give Israel the praise for instruction and wisdom; and since not only the readers need to become skillful themselves, but also those who love learning must be able to profit those who are outside, both by speaking and writing; my grandfather Jesus, having much given himself to the reading of the law, and the prophets, and the other books of our fathers, and having gained great familiarity with them, was also drawn on himself to write somewhat pertaining to instruction and wisdom, in order that those who love learning, and are devoted to these things, might make progress much more by living according to the law. You are entreated therefore to read with favor and attention, and to pardon us, if in any parts of what we have labored to interpret, we may seem to fail in some of the phrases. For things originally spoken in Hebrew don’t have the same force in them when they are translated into another language. Not only these, but the law itself, and the prophecies, and the rest of the books, have no small difference, when they are spoken in their original language. For having come into Egypt in the thirty-eighth year of Energetes the king, and having continued there some time, I found a copy giving no small instruction. I thought it therefore most necessary for me to apply some diligence and travail to translate this book, applying indeed much watchfulness and skill in that space of time to bring the book to an end and publish for them also, who in the land of their travels are desiring to learn, preparing their character in advance, so as to live according to the law.

### Chapter 1

All wisdom comes from the Lord,

and is with him forever.

Who can count the sand of the seas,

the drops of rain,

and the days of eternity?

Who will search out the height of the sky,

the breadth of the earth, the deep,

and wisdom?

Wisdom has been created before all things,

and the understanding of prudence from everlasting.

To whom has the root of wisdom been revealed?

Who has known her shrewd counsels?

There is one wise, greatly to be feared,

sitting upon his throne: the Lord.

He created her.

He saw and measured her.

He poured her out upon all his works.

She is with all flesh according to his gift.

He gave her freely to those who love him.

The fear of the Lord is glory, exultation,

gladness, and a crown of rejoicing.

The fear of the Lord will delight the heart,

and will give gladness, joy, and length of days.

Whoever fears the Lord, it will go well with him at the last.

He will be blessed in the day of his death.

To fear the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.

It was created together with the faithful in the womb.

She laid an eternal foundation with men.

She will be trusted among their offspring.

To fear the Lord is the fullness of wisdom.

She inebriates men with her fruits.

She will fill all her house with desirable things,

and her storehouses with her produce.

The fear of the Lord is the crown of wisdom,

making peace and perfect health to flourish.

He both saw and measured her.

He rained down skill and knowledge of understanding,

and exalted the honor of those who hold her fast.

To fear the Lord is the root of wisdom.

Her branches are length of days.

Unjust wrath can never be justified,

for his wrath tips the scale to his downfall.

A man that is patient will resist for a season,

and afterward gladness will spring up to him.

He will hide his words until the right moment,

and the lips of many will tell of his understanding.

A wise saying is in the treasures of wisdom;

but godliness is an abomination to a sinner.

If you desire wisdom, keep the commandments

and the Lord will give her to you freely;

for the fear of the Lord is wisdom and instruction.

Faith and humility are his good pleasure.

Don’t disobey the fear of the Lord.

Don’t come to him with a double heart.

Don’t be a hypocrite in men’s sight.

Keep watch over your lips.

Don’t exalt yourself,

lest you fall and bring dishonor upon your soul.

The Lord will reveal your secrets

and will cast you down in the midst of the congregation,

because you didn’t come to the fear of the Lord

and your heart was full of deceit.

### Chapter 2

My son, if you come to serve the Lord,

prepare your soul for temptation.

Set your heart aright, constantly endure,

and don’t make haste in time of calamity.

Cling to him, and don’t depart,

that you may be increased at your latter end.

Accept whatever is brought upon you,

and be patient when you suffer humiliation.

For gold is tried in the fire,

and acceptable men in the furnace of humiliation.

Put your trust in him, and he will help you.

Make your ways straight, and set your hope on him.

All you who fear the Lord, wait for his mercy.

Don’t turn aside, lest you fall.

All you who fear the Lord, put your trust in him,

and your reward will not fail.

All you who fear the Lord, hope for good things,

and for eternal gladness and mercy.

Look at the generations of old, and see:

Who ever put his trust in the Lord, and was ashamed?

Or who remained in his fear, and was forsaken?

Or who called upon him, and he neglected him?

For the Lord is full of compassion and mercy.

He forgives sins and saves in time of affliction.

Woe to fearful hearts, to faint hands,

and to the sinner who goes two ways!

Woe to the faint heart! For it doesn’t believe.

Therefore it won’t be defended.

Woe to you who have lost your patience!

And what will you all do when the Lord visits you?

Those who fear the Lord will not disobey his words.

Those who love him will keep his ways.

Those who fear the Lord will seek his good pleasure.

Those who love him will be filled with the law.

Those who fear the Lord will prepare their hearts,

and will humble their souls in his sight.

We will fall into the hands of the Lord,

and not into the hands of men;

for as his majesty is,

so also is his mercy.

### Chapter 3

Hear me, your father, O my children,

and do what you hear, that you all may be safe.

For the Lord honors the father over the children,

and has confirmed the judgment of the mother over her sons.

He who honors his father will make atonement for sins.

He who gives glory to his mother is as one who lays up treasure.

Whoever honors his father will have joy in his own children.

He will be heard in the day of his prayer.

He who gives glory to his father will have length of days.

He who listens to the Lord will bring rest to his mother,

and will serve under his parents, as to masters.

Honor your father in deed and word,

that a blessing may come upon you from him.

For the blessing of the father establishes the houses of children,

but the curse of the mother roots out the foundations.

Don’t glorify yourself in the dishonor of your father,

for your father’s dishonor is no glory to you.

For the glory of a man is from the honor of his father,

and a mother in dishonor is a reproach to her children.

My son, help your father in his old age,

and don’t grieve him as long as he lives.

If he fails in understanding, have patience with him.

Don’t dishonor him in your full strength.

For the kindness to your father will not be forgotten.

Instead of sins it will be added to build you up.

In the day of your affliction it will be remembered for you,

as fair weather upon ice,

so your sins will also melt away.

He who forsakes his father is as a blasphemer.

He who provokes his mother is cursed by the Lord.

My son, go on with your business in humility;

so you will be loved by an acceptable man.

The greater you are, humble yourself the more,

and you will find favor before the Lord.

For the power of the Lord is great,

and he is glorified by those who are lowly.

Don’t seek things that are too hard for you,

and don’t search out things that are above your strength.

Think about the things that have been commanded you,

for you have no need of the things that are secret.

Don’t be overly busy in tasks that are beyond you,

for more things are shown to you than men can understand.

For the conceit of many has led them astray.

Evil opinion has caused their judgment to slip.

There is no light without eyes.

There is no wisdom without knowledge.

A stubborn heart will do badly at the end.

He who loves danger will perish in it.

A stubborn heart will be burdened with troubles.

The sinner will heap sin upon sins.

The calamity of the proud has no healing,

for a weed of wickedness has taken root in him.

The heart of the prudent will understand a proverb.

A wise man desires the ear of a listener.

Water will quench a flaming fire;

almsgiving will make atonement for sins.

He who repays good turns is mindful of that which comes afterward.

In the time of his falling he will find a support.

### Chapter 4

My son, don’t deprive the poor of his living.

Don’t make the needy eyes wait long.

Don’t make a hungry soul sorrowful,

or provoke a man in his distress.

Don’t add more trouble to a heart that is provoked.

Don’t put off giving to him who is in need.

Don’t reject a suppliant in his affliction.

Don’t turn your face away from a poor man.

Don’t turn your eye away from one who asks.

Give no occasion to a man to curse you.

For if he curses you in the bitterness of his soul,

he who made him will hear his supplication.

Endear yourself to the assembly.

Bow your head to a great man.

Incline your ear to a poor man.

Answer him with peaceful words in humility.

Deliver him who is wronged from the hand of him who wrongs him;

Don’t be hesitant in giving judgment.

Be as a father to the fatherless,

and like a husband to their mother.

So you will be as a son of the Most High,

and he will love you more than your mother does.

Wisdom exalts her sons,

and takes hold of those who seek her.

He who loves her loves life.

Those who seek her early will be filled with gladness.

He who holds her fast will inherit glory.

Where he enters, the Lord will bless.

Those who serve her minister to the Holy One.

The Lord loves those who love her.

He who listens to her will judge the nations.

He who heeds her will dwell securely.

If he trusts her, he will inherit her,

and his generations will possess her.

For at the first she will walk with him in crooked ways,

and will bring fear and dread upon him,

and torment him with her discipline,

until she may trust his soul, and try him by her judgments.

Then she will return him again to the straight way,

and will gladden him, and reveal to him her secrets.

If he goes astray, she will forsake him,

and hand him over to his fall.

Watch for the opportunity, and beware of evil.

Don’t be ashamed of your soul.

For there is a shame that brings sin,

and there is a shame that is glory and grace.

Don’t show partiality, discrediting your soul.

Don’t revere any man to your falling.

Don’t refrain from speaking when it is for safety.

Don’t hide your wisdom for the sake of seeming fair.

For wisdom will be known by speech,

and instruction by the word of the tongue.

Don’t speak against the truth

and be shamed for your ignorance.

Don’t be ashamed to confess your sins.

Don’t fight the river’s current.

Don’t lay yourself down for a fool to tread upon.

Don’t be partial to one who is mighty.

Strive for the truth to death,

and the Lord God will fight for you.

Don’t be hasty with your tongue,

or slack and negligent in your deeds.

Don’t be like a lion in your house,

or suspicious of your servants.

Don’t let your hand be stretched out to receive,

and closed when you should repay.

### Chapter 5

Don’t set your heart upon your goods.

Don’t say, “They are sufficient for me.”

Don’t follow your own mind and your strength

to walk in the desires of your heart.

Don’t say, “Who will have dominion over me?”

for the Lord will surely take vengeance on you.

Don’t say, “I sinned, and what happened to me?”

for the Lord is patient.

Don’t be so confident of atonement

that you add sin upon sins.

Don’t say, “His compassion is great.

He will be pacified for the multitude of my sins,”

for mercy and wrath are with him,

and his indignation will rest on sinners.

Don’t wait to turn to the Lord.

Don’t put off from day to day;

for suddenly the wrath of the Lord will come on you,

and you will perish in the time of vengeance.

Don’t set your heart upon unrighteous gains,

for you will profit nothing in the day of calamity.

Don’t winnow with every wind.

Don’t walk in every path.

This is what the sinner who has a double tongue does.

Be steadfast in your understanding.

Let your speech be consistent.

Be swift to hear

and answer with patience.

If you have understanding, answer your neighbor;

but if not, put your hand over your mouth.

Glory and dishonor is in talk.

A man’s tongue may be his downfall.

Don’t be called a whisperer.

Don’t lie in wait with your tongue;

for shame is on the thief,

and an evil condemnation is on him who has a double tongue.

Don’t be ignorant in a great or small matter.

### Chapter 6

Don’t become an enemy instead of a friend;

for an evil name will inherit shame and reproach.

So it is with the sinner who has a double tongue.

Don’t exalt yourself in the counsel of your soul,

that your soul not be torn in pieces like a bull.

You will eat up your leaves, destroy your fruit,

and leave yourself like a dry tree.

A wicked soul will destroy him who has it,

and will make him a laughing stock to his enemies.

Sweet words will multiply a man’s friends.

A gracious tongue will multiply courtesies.

Let those that are at peace with you be many,

but your advisers one of a thousand.

If you want to gain a friend, get him in a time of testing,

and don’t be in a hurry to trust him.

For there is a friend just for an occasion.

He won’t continue in the day of your affliction.

And there is a friend who turns into an enemy.

He will discover strife to your reproach.

And there is a friend who is a companion at the table,

but he won’t continue in the day of your affliction.

In your prosperity he will be as yourself,

and will be bold over your servants.

If you are brought low, he will be against you,

and will hide himself from your face.

Separate yourself from your enemies,

and beware of your friends.

A faithful friend is a strong defense.

He who has found him has found a treasure.

There is nothing that can be taken in exchange for a faithful friend.

His excellency is beyond price.

A faithful friend is a life-saving medicine.

Those who fear the Lord will find him.

He who fears the Lord directs his friendship properly;

for as he is, so is his neighbor also.

My son, gather instruction from your youth up.

Even when you have gray hair you will find wisdom.

Come to her as one who plows and sows

and wait for her good fruit;

for your toil will be little in her cultivation,

and you will soon eat of her fruit.

How exceedingly harsh she is to the unlearned!

He who is without understanding will not remain in her.

She will rest upon him as a mighty stone of trial.

He won’t hesitate to cast her from him.

For wisdom is according to her name.

She isn’t manifest to many.

Give ear, my son, and accept my judgment.

Don’t refuse my counsel.

Bring your feet into her fetters,

and your neck into her chain.

Put your shoulder under her and bear her.

Don’t be grieved with her bonds.

Come to her with all your soul.

Keep her ways with your whole power.

Search and seek, and she will be made known to you.

When you get hold of her, don’t let her go.

For at the last you will find her rest;

and she will be turned for you into gladness.

Her fetters will be to you for a covering of strength,

and her chains for a robe of glory.

For there is a golden ornament upon her,

and her bands are a purple cord.

You shall put her on as a robe of glory,

and shall put her on as a crown of rejoicing.

My son, if you are willing, you will be instructed.

If you will yield your soul, you will be prudent.

If you love to hear, you will receive.

If you incline your ear, you will be wise.

Stand in the multitude of the elders.

Attach yourself to whomever is wise.

Be willing to listen to every godly discourse.

Don’t let the proverbs of understanding escape you.

If you see a man of understanding, get to him early.

Let your foot wear out the steps of his doors.

Let your mind dwell on the ordinances of the Lord

and meditate continually on his commandments.

He will establish your heart

and your desire for wisdom will be given to you.

### Chapter 7

Do no evil,

so no evil will overtake you.

Depart from wrong,

and it will turn away from you.

My son, don’t sow upon the furrows of unrighteousness,

and you won’t reap them sevenfold.

Don’t seek preeminence from the Lord,

nor the seat of honor from the king.

Don’t justify yourself in the presence of the Lord,

and don’t display your wisdom before the king.

Don’t seek to be a judge,

lest you not be able to take away iniquities,

lest perhaps you fear the person of a mighty man,

and lay a stumbling block in the way of your uprightness.

Don’t sin against the multitude of the city.

Don’t disgrace yourself in the crowd.

Don’t commit a sin twice,

for even in one you will not be unpunished.

Don’t say, “He will look upon the multitude of my gifts.

When I make an offering to the Most High God, he will accept it.”

Don’t be faint-hearted in your prayer.

Don’t neglect to give alms.

Don’t laugh a man to scorn when he is in the bitterness of his soul,

for there is one who humbles and exalts.

Don’t devise a lie against your brother,

or do the same to a friend.

Refuse to utter a lie,

for that habit results in no good.

Don’t babble in the assembly of elders.

Don’t repeat your words in your prayer.

Don’t hate hard labor

or farm work, which the Most High has created.

Don’t number yourself among the multitude of sinners.

Remember that wrath will not wait.

Humble your soul greatly,

for the punishment of the ungodly man is fire and the worm.

Don’t exchange a friend for something,

neither a true brother for the gold of Ophir.

Don’t deprive yourself of a wise and good wife,

for her grace is worth more than gold.

Don’t abuse a servant who works faithfully,

or a hireling who gives you his life.

Let your soul love a wise servant.

Don’t defraud him of liberty.

Do you have cattle? Look after them.

If they are profitable to you, let them stay by you.

Do you have children? Correct them,

and make them obedient from their youth.

Do you have daughters? Take care of their bodies,

and don’t be overly indulgent toward them.

Give your daughter in marriage, and you will have accomplished a great matter.

Give her to a man of understanding.

Do you have a wife who pleases you? Don’t cast her out.

But don’t trust yourself to one who is hateful.

Honor your father with your whole heart,

and don’t forget the birth pangs of your mother.

Remember that you were born of them.

What will you repay them for the things that they have done for you?

Fear the Lord with all your soul;

and revere his priests.

With all your strength love him who made you.

Don’t forsake his ministers.

Fear the Lord and honor the priest.

Give him his portion, even as it is commanded you:

the first fruits, the trespass offering, the gift of the shoulders,

the sacrifice of sanctification, and the first fruits of holy things.

Also stretch out your hand to the poor man,

that your blessing may be complete.

A gift has grace in the sight of every living man.

Don’t withhold grace for a dead man.

Don’t avoid those who weep,

and mourn with those who mourn.

Don’t be slow to visit a sick man,

for by such things you will gain love.

In all your words, remember eternity,

and you will never sin.

### Chapter 8

Don’t contend with a mighty man,

lest perhaps you fall into his hands.

Don’t strive with a rich man, lest perhaps he overpower you;

for gold has destroyed many,

and turned away the hearts of kings.

Don’t argue with a loudmouthed man.

Don’t heap wood upon his fire.

Don’t make fun of a rude man,

lest your ancestors be dishonored.

Don’t reproach a man when he turns from sin.

Remember that we are all worthy of punishment.

Don’t dishonor a man in his old age,

for some of us are also growing old.

Don’t rejoice over anyone’s death.

Remember that we all die.

Don’t neglect the discourse of the wise.

Be conversant with their proverbs;

for from them you will learn discipline

and how to serve great men.

Don’t miss the discourse of the aged,

for they also learned from their parents,

because from them you will learn understanding,

and to give an answer in time of need.

Don’t kindle the coals of a sinner,

lest you be burned with the flame of his fire.

Don’t rise up from the presence of an insolent man,

lest he lie in wait as an ambush for your mouth.

Don’t lend to a man who is stronger than you;

and if you lend, count it as a loss.

Don’t be surety beyond your means.

If you give surety, think as one who will have to pay.

Don’t go to law with a judge;

for according to his honor they will give judgment for him.

Don’t travel with a reckless man,

lest he be burdensome to you;

for he will do as he pleases,

and you will perish with his folly.

Don’t fight with a wrathful man.

Don’t travel with him through the desert,

for blood is as nothing in his sight.

Where there is no help, he will overthrow you.

Don’t consult with a fool,

for he will not be able to keep a secret.

Do no secret thing before a stranger,

for you don’t know what it will cause.

Don’t open your heart to every man.

Don’t let him return you a favor.

### Chapter 9

Don’t be jealous over the wife of your bosom,

and don’t teach her an evil lesson against yourself.

Don’t give your soul to a woman

and let her trample down your strength.

Don’t go to meet a woman who plays the prostitute,

lest perhaps you fall into her snares.

Don’t associate with a woman who is a singer,

lest perhaps you be caught by her tricks.

Don’t gaze at a virgin,

lest perhaps you stumble and incur penalties for her.

Don’t give your soul to prostitutes,

that you not lose your inheritance.

Don’t look around in the streets of the city.

Don’t wander in its deserted places.

Turn your eye away from a beautiful woman,

and don’t gaze at another’s beauty.

Many have been led astray by the beauty of a woman;

and with this, passion is kindled like a fire.

Don’t dine at all with a woman who has a husband,

or revel with her at wine,

lest perhaps your soul turn away to her,

and with your spirit you slide into destruction.

Don’t forsake an old friend;

for a new one is not comparable to him.

A new friend is like new wine:

if it becomes old, you will drink it with gladness.

Don’t envy the success of a sinner;

for you don’t know what his end will be.

Don’t delight in the delights of the ungodly.

Remember they will not go unpunished to the grave.

Keep yourself far from the man who has power to kill,

and you will not be troubled by the fear of death.

If you come to him, commit no fault,

lest he take away your life.

Know surely that you go about in the midst of snares,

and walk upon the battlements of a city.

As well as you can, aim to know your neighbors,

and take counsel with the wise.

Let your conversation be with men of understanding.

Let all your discourse be in the law of the Most High.

Let righteous people be companions at your table.

Let your glorying be in the fear of the Lord.

A work is commended because of the skill of the artisan;

so he who rules the people will be considered wise for his speech.

A loudmouthed man is dangerous in his city.

He who is reckless in his speech will be hated.

### Chapter 10

A wise judge will instruct his people.

The government of a man of understanding will be well ordered.

As is the judge of his people, so are his officials.

As the city’s ruler is, so are all those who dwell in it.

An undisciplined king will destroy his people.

A city will be established through the understanding of the powerful.

The government of the earth is in the Lord’s hand.

In due time, he will raise up over it the right person at the right time.

A man’s prosperity is in the Lord’s hand.

He will lay his honor upon the person of the scribe.

Don’t be angry with your neighbor for every wrong.

Do nothing by works of violence.

Pride is hateful before the Lord and men.

Arrogance is abhorrent in the judgment of both.

Sovereignty is transferred from nation to nation

because of injustice, violence, and greed for money.

Why are dirt and ashes proud?

Because in life, my body decays.

A long disease mocks the physician.

The king of today will die tomorrow.

For when a man is dead,

he will inherit maggots, vermin, and worms.

It is the beginning of pride when a man departs from the Lord.

His heart has departed from him who made him.

For the beginning of pride is sin.

He who keeps it will pour out abomination.

For this cause the Lord brought upon them strange calamities

and utterly overthrew them.

The Lord cast down the thrones of rulers

and set the lowly in their place.

The Lord plucked up the roots of nations

and planted the lowly in their place.

The Lord overthrew the lands of nations

and destroyed them to the foundations of the earth.

He took some of them away and destroyed them,

and made their memory to cease from the earth.

Pride has not been created for men,

nor wrathful anger for the offspring of women.

Whose offspring has honor?

Human offspring who fear the Lord.

Whose offspring has no honor?

Human offspring who break the commandments.

In the midst of kindred he who rules them has honor.

Those who fear the Lord have honor in his eyes.

The rich man, the honorable, and the poor

all glory in the fear of the Lord.

It is not right to dishonor a poor man who has understanding.

It is not fitting to glorify a man who is a sinner.

The prince, the judge, and the mighty man will be honored.

There is not one of them greater than he who fears the Lord.

Free men will minister to a wise servant.

A man who has knowledge will not complain.

Don’t flaunt your wisdom in doing your work.

Don’t boast in the time of your distress.

Better is he who labors and abounds in all things,

than he who boasts and lacks bread.

My son, glorify your soul in humility,

and ascribe to yourself honor according to your worthiness.

Who will justify him who sins against his own soul?

Who will honor him who dishonors his own life?

A poor man is honored for his knowledge.

A rich man is honored for his riches.

But he who is honored in poverty, how much more in riches?

He who is dishonored in riches, how much more in poverty?

### Chapter 11

The wisdom of the lowly will lift up his head,

and make him sit in the midst of great men.

Don’t commend a man for his good looks.

Don’t abhor a man for his outward appearance.

The bee is little among flying creatures,

but what it produces is the best of confections.

Don’t boast about the clothes you wear,

and don’t exalt yourself in the day of honor;

for the Lord’s works are wonderful,

and his works are hidden among men.

Many kings have sat down upon the ground,

but one who was never thought of has worn a crown.

Many mighty men have been greatly disgraced.

Men of renown have been delivered into other men’s hands.

Don’t blame before you investigate.

Understand first, and then rebuke.

Don’t answer before you have heard.

Don’t interrupt while someone else is speaking.

Don’t argue about a matter that doesn’t concern you.

Don’t sit with sinners when they judge.

My son, don’t be busy about many matters;

for if you meddle much, you will not be unpunished.

If you pursue, you will not overtake,

and you will not escape by fleeing.

There is one who toils, labors, and hurries,

and is even more behind.

There is one who is sluggish, and needs help,

lacking in strength, and who abounds in poverty,

but the Lord’s eyes looked upon him for good,

and he raised him up from his low condition,

and lifted up his head

so that many marveled at him.

Good things and bad, life and death,

poverty and riches, are from the Lord. -

The Lord’s gift remains with the godly.

His good pleasure will prosper forever.

One grows rich by his diligence and self-denial,

and this is the portion of his reward:

when he says, “I have found rest,

and now I will eat of my goods!”

he doesn’t know how much time will pass

until he leaves them to others and dies.

Be steadfast in your covenant and be doing it,

and grow old in your work.

Don’t marvel at the works of a sinner,

but trust the Lord and stay in your labor;

for it is an easy thing in the sight of the Lord

to swiftly and suddenly make a poor man rich.

The Lord’s blessing is in the reward of the godly.

He makes his blessing flourish in an hour that comes swiftly.

Don’t say, “What use is there of me?

What further good things can be mine?”

Don’t say, “I have enough.

What harm could happen to me now?”

In the day of good things, bad things are forgotten.

In the day of bad things, a man will not remember things that are good.

For it is an easy thing in the sight of the Lord

to reward a man in the day of death according to his ways.

The affliction of an hour causes delights to be forgotten.

In the end, a man’s deeds are revealed.

Call no man happy before his death.

A man will be known in his children.

Don’t bring every man into your house,

for many are the tricks of a deceitful man.

Like a decoy partridge in a cage, so is the heart of a proud man.

Like a spy, he looks for your weakness.

For he lies in wait to turn things that are good into evil,

and assigns blame in things that are praiseworthy.

From a spark of fire, a heap of many coals is kindled,

and a sinful man lies in wait to shed blood.

Take heed of an evil-doer, for he plans wicked things,

lest perhaps he ruin your reputation forever.

Receive a stranger into your house, and he will distract you with arguments

and estrange you from your own family.

### Chapter 12

If you do good, know to whom you do it,

and your good deeds will have thanks.

Do good to a godly man, and you will find a reward—

if not from him, then from the Most High.

No good will come to him who continues to do evil,

nor to him who gives no alms.

Give to the godly man,

and don’t help the sinner.

Do good to one who is lowly.

Don’t give to an ungodly man.

Keep back his bread, and don’t give it to him,

lest he subdue you with it;

for you would receive twice as much evil

for all the good you would have done to him.

For the Most High also hates sinners,

and will repay vengeance to the ungodly.

Give to the good man,

and don’t help the sinner.

A man’s friend won’t be fully tried in prosperity.

His enemy won’t be hidden in adversity.

In a man’s prosperity, his enemies are grieved.

In his adversity, even his friend leaves.

Never trust your enemy,

for his wickedness is like corrosion in copper.

Though he humbles himself and walks bowed down,

still be careful and beware of him.

You will be to him as one who has wiped a mirror,

to be sure it doesn’t completely tarnish.

Don’t set him next to you,

lest he overthrow you and stand in your place.

Don’t let him sit on your right hand,

lest he seek to take your seat,

and at the last you acknowledge my words,

and be pricked with my sayings.

Who will pity a charmer that is bitten by a snake,

or any who come near wild beasts?

Even so, who will pity him who goes to a sinner,

and is associated with him in his sins?

For a while he will stay with you,

and if you falter, he will not stay.

The enemy will speak sweetly with his lips,

and in his heart plan to throw you into a pit.

The enemy may weep with his eyes,

but if he finds opportunity, he will want more blood.

If adversity meets you, you will find him there before you.

Pretending to help you, he will trip you.

He will shake his head, clap his hands,

whisper much, and change his countenance.

### Chapter 13

He who touches pitch will be defiled.

He who has fellowship with a proud man will become like him.

Don’t take up a burden above your strength.

Have no fellowship with one who is mightier and richer than yourself.

What fellowship would the earthen pot have with the kettle?

The kettle will strike, and the pot will be dashed in pieces.

The rich man does a wrong and threatens.

The poor is wronged and apologizes.

If you are profitable, he will exploit you.

If you are in need, he will forsake you.

If you own something, he will live with you.

He will drain your resources and will not be sorry.

Does he need you? Then he will deceive you,

smile at you, and give you hope.

He will speak kindly to you and say, “What do you need?”

He will shame you by his delicacies

until he has made you bare twice or thrice,

and in the end he will laugh you to scorn.

Afterward he will see you, will forsake you,

and shake his head at you.

Beware that you are not deceived

and brought low in your enjoyment.

If a mighty man invites you, be reserved,

and he will invite you more.

Don’t press him, lest you be thrust back.

Don’t stand far off, lest you be forgotten.

Don’t try to speak with him as an equal,

and don’t believe his many words;

for he will test you with much talk,

and will examine you in a smiling manner.

He who doesn’t keep secrets to himself is unmerciful.

He won’t hesitate to harm and to bind.

Keep them to yourself and be careful,

for you walk in danger of falling.

Every living creature loves its own kind,

and every man loves his neighbor.

All flesh associates with their own kind.

A man will stick to people like himself.

What fellowship would the wolf have with the lamb?

So is the sinner to the godly.

What peace is there between a hyena and a dog?

What peace is there between a rich man and the poor?

Wild donkeys are the prey of lions in the wilderness;

likewise poor men are feeding grounds for the rich.

Lowliness is an abomination to a proud man;

likewise a poor man is an abomination to the rich.

When a rich man is shaken, he is supported by his friends,

but when the humble is down, he is pushed away even by his friends.

When a rich man falls, there are many helpers.

He speaks things not to be spoken, and men justify him.

A humble man falls, and men rebuke him.

He utters wisdom, and is not listened to.

A rich man speaks, and all keep silence.

They extol what he says to the clouds.

A poor man speaks, and they say, “Who is this?”

If he stumbles, they will help to overthrow him.

Riches are good if they have no sin.

Poverty is evil only in the opinion of the ungodly.

The heart of a man changes his countenance,

whether it is for good or for evil.

A cheerful countenance is a sign of a prosperous heart.

Devising proverbs takes strenuous thinking.

### Chapter 14

Blessed is the man who has not slipped with his mouth,

and doesn’t suffer from sorrow for sins.

Blessed is he whose soul does not condemn him,

and who has not given up hope.

Riches are not appropriate for a stingy person.

What would a miser do with money?

He who gathers by denying himself gathers for others.

Others will revel in his goods.

If one is mean to himself, to whom will he be good?

He won’t enjoy his possessions.

There is none more evil than he who is grudging to himself.

This is a punishment for his wickedness.

Even if he does good, he does it in forgetfulness.

In the end, he reveals his wickedness.

A miser is evil.

He turns away and disregards souls.

A covetous man’s eye is not satisfied with his portion.

Wicked injustice dries up his soul.

A miser begrudges bread,

and it is lacking at his table.

My son, according to what you have, treat yourself well,

and bring worthy offerings to the Lord.

Remember that death will not wait,

and that the covenant of Hades hasn’t been shown to you.

Do good to your friends before you die.

According to your ability, reach out and give to them.

Don’t deprive yourself of a good day.

Don’t let your share of a desired good pass you by.

Won’t you leave your labors to another,

and your toils be divided by lot?

Give, take, and treat yourself well,

because there is no seeking of luxury in Hades.

All flesh grows old like a garment,

for the covenant from the beginning is, “You must die!”

Like the leaves flourishing on a thick tree,

some it sheds, and some grow,

so also are the generations of flesh and blood:

one comes to an end and another is born.

Every work rots and falls away,

and its builder will depart with it.

Blessed is the man who meditates on wisdom,

and who reasons by his understanding.

He who considers her ways in his heart

will also have knowledge of her secrets.

Go after her like a hunter,

and lie in wait in her paths.

He who peers in at her windows

will also listen at her doors.

He who lodges close to her house

will also fasten a nail in her walls.

He will pitch his tent near at hand to her,

and will lodge in a lodging where good things are.

He will set his children under her shelter,

and will rest under her branches.

By her he will be covered from heat,

and will lodge in her glory.

### Chapter 15

He who fears the Lord will do this.

He who has possession of the law will obtain her.

She will meet him like a mother,

and receive him like a wife married in her virginity.

She will feed him with bread of understanding

and give him water of wisdom to drink.

He will be stayed upon her, and will not be moved.

He will rely upon her, and will not be confounded.

She will exalt him above his neighbors.

She will open his mouth in the midst of the congregation.

He will inherit joy, a crown of gladness,

and an everlasting name.

Foolish men will not obtain her.

Sinners will not see her.

She is far from pride.

Liars will not remember her.

Praise is not attractive in the mouth of a sinner;

for it was not sent to him from the Lord.

For praise will be spoken in wisdom;

The Lord will prosper it.

Don’t say, “It is through the Lord that I fell away;”

for you shall not do the things that he hates.

Don’t say, “It is he that caused me to err;”

for he has no need of a sinful man.

The Lord hates every abomination;

and those who fear him don’t love them.

He himself made man from the beginning

and left him in the hand of his own counsel.

If you choose, you can keep the commandments.

To be faithful is a matter of your choice.

He has set fire and water before you.

You will stretch forth your hand to whichever you desire.

Before man is life and death.

Whichever he likes, it will be given to him.

For the wisdom of the Lord is great.

He is mighty in power, and sees all things.

His eyes are upon those who fear him.

He knows every act of man.

He has not commanded any man to be ungodly.

He has not given any man license to sin.

### Chapter 16

Don’t desire a multitude of unprofitable children,

neither delight in ungodly sons.

If they multiply, don’t delight in them

unless the fear of the Lord is in them.

Don’t trust in their life.

Don’t rely on their numbers;

for one can be better than a thousand,

and to die childless than to have ungodly children.

For from one who has understanding, a city will be populated,

but a race of wicked men will be made desolate.

I have seen many such things with my eyes.

My ear has heard mightier things than these.

In a congregation of sinners, a fire will be kindled.

In a disobedient nation, wrath is kindled.

He was not pacified toward the giants of old time,

who revolted in their strength.

He didn’t spare Lot’s neighbors,

whom he abhorred for their pride.

He didn’t pity the people of perdition

who were taken away in their sins,

or in like manner, the six hundred thousand footmen

who were gathered together in the hardness of their hearts.

Even if there is one stiff-necked person,

it is a marvel if he will be unpunished;

for mercy and wrath are both with him who is mighty to forgive,

and he pours out wrath.

As his mercy is great, so is his correction also.

He judges a man according to his works.

The sinner will not escape with plunder.

The perseverance of the godly will not be frustrated.

He will make room for every work of mercy.

Each man will receive according to his works. -

Don’t say, “I will be hidden from the Lord,”

and “Who will remember me from on high?”

I will not be known among so many people,

for what is my soul in a boundless creation?

Behold, the heaven, the heaven of heavens,

the deep, and the earth, will be moved when he visits.

The mountains and the foundations of the earth together

are shaken with trembling when he looks at them.

No heart will think about these things.

Who could comprehend his ways?

Like a tempest which no man can see,

so, the majority of his works are hidden.

Who will declare his works of righteousness?

Who will wait for them?

For his covenant is afar off.

He who is lacking in understanding thinks about these things.

An unwise and erring man thinks foolishly.

My son, listen to me, learn knowledge,

and heed my words with your heart.

I will impart instruction with precision,

and declare knowledge exactly.

In the judgment of the Lord are his works from the beginning.

From the making of them he determined their boundaries.

He arranged his works for all time,

and their beginnings to their generations.

They aren’t hungry or weary,

and they don’t cease from their works.

No one pushes aside his neighbor.

They will never disobey his word.

After this also the Lord looked at the earth

and filled it with his blessings.

All manner of living things covered its surface,

and they return into it.

### Chapter 17

The Lord created mankind out of earth,

and turned them back to it again.

He gave them days by number, and a set time,

and gave them authority over the things that are on it.

He endowed them with strength proper to them,

and made them according to his own image.

He put the fear of man upon all flesh,

and gave him dominion over beasts and birds.

He gave them counsel, tongue, eyes,

ears, and heart to have understanding.

He filled them with the knowledge of wisdom,

and showed them good and evil.

He set his eye upon their hearts,

to show them the majesty of his works.

And they will praise his holy name,

that they may declare the majesty of his works.

He added to them knowledge,

and gave them a law of life for a heritage.

He made an everlasting covenant with them,

and showed them his decrees.

Their eyes saw the majesty of his glory.

Their ears heard the glory of his voice.

He said to them, “Beware of all unrighteousness.”

So he gave them commandment, each man concerning his neighbor.

Their ways are ever before him.

They will not be hidden from his eyes.

For every nation he appointed a ruler,

but Israel is the Lord’s portion.

All their works are as clear as the sun before him.

His eyes are continually upon their ways.

Their iniquities are not hidden from him.

All their sins are before the Lord.

With him the alms of a man is as a signet.

He will keep a man’s kindness as the pupil of the eye.

Afterwards he will rise up and repay them,

and render their repayment upon their head.

However to those who repent he grants a return.

He comforts those who are losing hope.

Return to the Lord, and forsake sins.

Make your prayer before his face offend less.

Turn again to the Most High, and turn away from iniquity.

Greatly hate the abominable thing.

Who will give praise to the Most High in Hades,

in place of the living who return thanks?

Thanksgiving perishes from the dead, as from one who doesn’t exist.

He who is in life and health will praise the Lord.

How great is the mercy of the Lord,

and his forgiveness to those who turn to him!

For humans are not capable of everything,

because the son of man is not immortal.

What is brighter than the sun? Yet even this can be eclipsed.

So flesh and blood devise evil.

He looks upon the power of the height of heaven,

while all men are earth and ashes.

### Chapter 18

He who lives forever created the whole universe.

The Lord alone is just.

He has given power to declare his works to no one.

Who could trace out his mighty deeds?

Who could measure the strength of his majesty?

Who could also proclaim his mercies?

As for the wondrous works of the Lord, it is not possible to take from them nor add to them,

neither is it possible to explore them.

When a man has finished, then he is just at the beginning.

When he stops, then he will be perplexed.

What is mankind, and what purpose do they serve?

What is their good, and what is their evil?

The number of man’s days at the most are a hundred years.

As a drop of water from the sea, and a pebble from the sand,

so are a few years in the day of eternity.

For this cause the Lord was patient over them,

and poured out his mercy upon them.

He saw and perceived their end, that it is evil.

Therefore he multiplied his forgiveness.

The mercy of a man is on his neighbor;

but the mercy of the Lord is on all flesh:

reproving, chastening, teaching,

and bringing back, as a shepherd does his flock.

He has mercy on those who accept chastening,

and that diligently seek after his judgments.

My son, don’t add reproach to your good deeds,

and no harsh words in any of your giving.

Doesn’t the dew relieve the scorching heat?

So a word is better than a gift.

Behold, isn’t a word better than a gift?

Both are with a gracious person.

A fool is ungracious and abusive.

The gift of an grudging person consumes the eyes.

Learn before you speak.

Take care of your health before you get sick.

Before judgment, examine yourself,

and in the hour of scrutiny you will find forgiveness.

Humble yourself before you get sick.

In the time of sins, repent.

Let nothing hinder you to pay your vow in due time.

Don’t wait until death to be released.

Before you make a vow, prepare yourself.

Don’t be like a man who tests the Lord.

Think about the wrath coming in the days of the end,

and the time of vengeance, when he turns away his face.

In the days of fullness remember the time of hunger.

Remember poverty and lack in the days of wealth.

From morning until evening, the time changes.

All things are speedy before the Lord.

A wise man is cautious in everything.

In days of sinning, he will beware of offense.

Every man of understanding knows wisdom.

He will give thanks to him who found her.

They who were of understanding in sayings also became wise themselves,

and poured out apt proverbs.

Don’t go after your lusts.

Restrain your appetites.

If you give fully to your soul the delight of her desire,

she will make you the laughing stock of your enemies.

Don’t make merry in much luxury,

and don’t be tied to its expense.

Don’t be made a beggar by banqueting with borrowed money

when you have nothing in your purse.

### Chapter 19

A worker who is a drunkard will not become rich.

He who despises small things will fall little by little.

Wine and women will make men of understanding go astray.

He who joins with prostitutes is reckless.

Decay and worms will have him as their heritage.

A reckless soul will be taken away.

He who is hasty to trust is shallow-hearted.

He who sins offends against his own soul.

He who rejoices in wickedness will be condemned.

He who hates gossip has less wickedness.

Never repeat what is told you,

and you won’t lose anything.

Whether it is of friend or foe, don’t tell it.

Unless it is a sin to you, don’t reveal it.

For if he has heard you and observed you,

when the time comes, he will hate you.

Have you heard something? Let it die with you.

Be brave: it will not make you burst!

A fool will travail in pain with a word,

as a woman in labor with a child.

As an arrow that sticks in the flesh of the thigh,

so is gossip in a fool.

Question a friend; it may be he didn’t do it.

If he did something, it may be that he may do it no more.

Question your neighbor; it may be he didn’t say it.

If he has said it, it may be that he may not say it again.

Question a friend; for many times there is slander.

Don’t trust every word.

There is one who slips, and not from the heart.

Who is he who hasn’t sinned with his tongue?

Reprove your neighbor before you threaten him;

and give place to the law of the Most High. -

All wisdom is the fear of the Lord.

In all wisdom is the doing of the law.

The knowledge of wickedness is not wisdom.

The prudence of sinners is not counsel.

There is a wickedness, and it is an abomination.

There is a fool lacking in wisdom.

Better is one who has little understanding, and fears God,

than one who has much intelligence and transgresses the law.

There is an exquisite subtlety, and it is unjust.

And there is one who perverts favor to gain a judgment.

There is one who does wickedly, who hangs down his head with mourning;

but inwardly he is full of deceit,

bowing down his face, and pretending to be deaf in one ear.

Where he isn’t known, he will take advantage of you.

And if for lack of power he is hindered from sinning,

if he finds opportunity, he will do mischief.

A man will be known by his appearance.

One who has understanding will be known by his face when you meet him.

A man’s attire, grinning laughter,

and the way he walks show what he is.

### Chapter 20

There is a reproof that is not timely;

and there is a person who is wise enough to keep silent.

How good is it to reprove, rather than to be angry.

He who confesses will be kept back from harm.

As is the lust of a eunuch to deflower a virgin,

so is he who executes judgments with violence.

There is one who keeps silent and is found wise;

and there is one who is hated for his much talk.

There is one who keeps silent, for he has no answer to make;

And there is one who keeps silent, knowing when to speak.

A wise man will be silent until his time has come,

but the braggart and fool will miss his time.

He who uses many words will be abhorred.

He who takes authority for himself will be hated in it.

There is a prosperity that a man finds in misfortunes;

and there is a gain that turns to loss.

There is a gift that will not profit you;

and there is a gift that pays back double.

There are losses because of glory;

and there is one who has lifted up his head from a low estate.

There is one who buys much for a little,

and pays for it again sevenfold.

He who is wise in words will make himself beloved;

but the pleasantries of fools will be wasted.

The gift of a fool will not profit you,

for he looks for repayment many times instead of one.

He will give little and insult much.

He will open his mouth like a crier.

Today he will lend, and tomorrow he will ask for it back.

Such a one is a hateful man.

The fool will say, “I have no friend,

and I have no thanks for my good deeds.

Those who eat my bread have an evil tongue.”

How often, and of how many, will he be laughed to scorn!

A slip on a pavement is better than a slip with the tongue.

So the fall of the wicked will come speedily.

A man without grace is a tale out of season.

It will be continually in the mouth of the ignorant.

A parable from a fool’s mouth will be rejected;

for he won’t tell it at the proper time.

There is one who is hindered from sinning through lack.

When he rests, he will not be troubled.

There is one who destroys his soul through bashfulness.

By a foolish countenance, he will destroy it.

There is one who for bashfulness makes promises to his friend;

and he makes him his enemy for nothing.

A lie is an ugly blot on a person.

It will be continually in the mouth of the ignorant.

A thief is better than a man who is continually lying,

but they both will inherit destruction.

The destination of a liar is dishonor.

His shame is with him continually.

He who is wise in words will advance himself.

And one who is prudent will please great men.

He who tills his land will raise his harvest high.

He who pleases great men will get pardon for iniquity.

Favors and gifts blind the eyes of the wise,

and as a muzzle on the mouth, turn away reproofs.

Wisdom that is hidden, and treasure that is out of sight—

what profit is in either of them?

Better is a man who hides his folly

than a man who hides his wisdom.

### Chapter 21

My son, have you sinned?

Do it no more;

and ask forgiveness for your past sins.

Flee from sin as from the face of a snake;

for if you go near, it will bite you.

Its teeth are like lion’s teeth,

slaying people’s souls.

All iniquity is as a two-edged sword.

Its stroke has no healing.

Terror and violence will waste away riches.

So the house of an arrogant man will be laid waste.

Supplication from a poor man’s mouth reaches to the ears of God,

and his judgment comes speedily.

One who hates reproof is in the path of the sinner.

He who fears the Lord will repent in his heart.

He who is mighty in tongue is known far away;

but the man of understanding knows when he slips.

He who builds his house with other men’s money

is like one who gathers stones for his own tomb.

The congregation of wicked men is as a bundle of tow

with a flame of fire at the end of them.

The way of sinners is paved with stones;

and at the end of it is the pit of Hades.

He who keeps the law becomes master of its intent.

The fulfilment of the fear of the Lord is wisdom.

He who is not clever will not be instructed.

There is a cleverness which makes bitterness abound.

The knowledge of a wise man will be made to abound as a flood,

and his counsel as a fountain of life.

The inward parts of a fool are like a broken vessel.

He will hold no knowledge.

If a man of knowledge hears a wise word,

he will commend it and add to it.

The wanton man hears it, and it displeases him,

so he throws it away behind his back.

The chatter of a fool is like a burden in the way,

but grace will be found on the lips of the wise.

The utterance of the prudent man will be sought for in the congregation.

They will ponder his words in their heart.

As a house that is destroyed, so is wisdom to a fool.

The knowledge of an unwise man is talk without sense.

Instruction is as fetters on the feet of an unwise man,

and as manacles on the right hand.

A fool lifts up his voice with laughter,

but a clever man smiles quietly.

Instruction is to a prudent man as an ornament of gold,

and as a bracelet upon his right arm.

The foot of a fool rushes into a house,

but a man of experience will be ashamed of entering.

A foolish man peers into the door of a house,

but a man who is instructed will stand outside.

It is rude for someone to listen at a door,

but a prudent person will be grieved with the disgrace.

The lips of strangers will be grieved at these things,

but the words of prudent men will be weighed in the balance.

The heart of fools is in their mouth,

but the mouth of wise men is their heart.

When the ungodly curses an adversary,

he curses his own soul.

A whisperer defiles his own soul,

and will be hated wherever he travels.

### Chapter 22

A slothful man is compared to a stone that is defiled.

Everyone will at hiss at him in his disgrace.

A slothful man is compared to the filth of a dunghill.

Anyone who picks it up will shake it out of his hand.

An undisciplined child is a disgrace to his father,

and a foolish daughter is born to his loss.

A prudent daughter will inherit a husband of her own.

She who brings shame is the grief of her father.

She who is arrogant brings shame on father and husband.

She will be despised by both of them.

Ill-timed conversation is like music in mourning,

but stripes and correction are wisdom in every season.

He who teaches a fool is like one who glues potsherds together,

even like one who wakes a sleeper out of a deep sleep.

He who teaches a fool is as one who teaches a man who slumbers.

In the end he will say, “What is it?” -

Weep for the dead, for he lacks light.

Weep for a fool, for he lacks understanding.

Weep more sweetly for the dead, because he has found rest,

but the life of the fool is worse than death.

Mourning for the dead lasts seven days,

but for a fool and an ungodly man, it lasts all the days of his life.

Don’t talk much with a foolish man,

and don’t go to one who has no understanding.

Beware of him, lest you have trouble and be defiled in his onslaught.

Turn away from him, and you will find rest,

and you won’t be wearied in his madness.

What would be heavier than lead?

What is its name, but “Fool”?

Sand, salt, and a mass of iron is easier to bear

than a man without understanding.

Timber girded and bound into a building will not be released with shaking.

So a heart established in due season on well advised counsel will not be afraid.

A heart settled upon a thoughtful understanding

is as an ornament of plaster on a polished wall.

Fences set on a high place will not stand against the wind;

so a fearful heart in the imagination of a fool will not stand against any fear.

He who pricks the eye will make tears fall.

He who pricks the heart makes it show feeling.

Whoever casts a stone at birds scares them away.

He who insults a friend will dissolve friendship.

If you have drawn a sword against a friend, don’t despair,

for there may be a way back.

If you have opened your mouth against a friend, don’t be afraid,

for there may be reconciliation,

unless it is for insulting, arrogance, disclosing of a secret, or a treacherous blow—

for these things any friend will flee.

Gain trust with your neighbor in his poverty,

that in his prosperity you may have gladness.

Stay steadfast to him in the time of his affliction,

that you may be heir with him in his inheritance.

Before fire is the vapor and smoke of a furnace,

so insults precede bloodshed.

I won’t be ashamed to shelter a friend.

I won’t hide myself from his face.

If any evil happens to me because of him,

everyone who hears it will beware of him.

Who will set a watch over my mouth,

and a seal of shrewdness upon my lips,

that I may not fall from it, and that my tongue may not destroy me?

### Chapter 23

O Lord, Father and Master of my life,

don’t abandon me to their counsel.

Don’t let me fall because of them.

Who will set scourges over my thought,

and a discipline of wisdom over my heart,

that they spare me not for my errors,

and not overlook their sins?

Otherwise my errors might be multiplied,

and my sins abound,

I fall before my adversaries,

and my enemy rejoice over me.

O Lord, Father and God of my life,

don’t give me a haughty eyes,

and turn away evil desire from me.

Let neither gluttony nor lust overtake me.

Don’t give me over to a shameless mind.

Listen, my children, to the discipline of the mouth.

He who keeps it will not be caught.

The sinner will be overpowered through his lips.

By them, the insulter and the arrogant will stumble.

Don’t accustom your mouth to an oath,

and don’t be accustomed to naming the Holy One,

for as a servant who is continually scourged will not lack bruises,

so he also who swears and continually utters the Name will not be cleansed from sin.

A man of many oaths will be filled with iniquity.

The scourge will not depart from his house.

If he offends, his sin will be upon him.

If he disregards it, he has sinned doubly.

If he has sworn falsely, he will not be justified,

for his house will be filled with calamities.

There is a manner of speech that is clothed with death.

Let it not be found in the heritage of Jacob,

for all these things will be far from the godly,

and they will not wallow in sins.

Don’t accustom your mouth to gross rudeness,

for it involves sinful speech.

Remember your father and your mother,

for you sit in the midst of great men,

that you be not forgetful before them,

and become a fool by your bad habit;

so you may wish that you had not been born,

and curse the day of your birth.

A man who is accustomed to abusive language

won’t be corrected all the days of his life.

Two sorts of people multiply sins,

and the third will bring wrath:

a hot passion, like a burning fire, will not be quenched until it is consumed;

a fornicator in the body of his flesh will never cease until he has burned out the fire.

All bread is sweet to a fornicator.

He will not cease until he dies.

A man who goes astray from his own marriage bed

says in his heart, “Who sees me?

Darkness is around me, and the walls hide me.

No one sees me. Of whom am I afraid?

The Most High will not remember my sins.”

The eyes of men are his terror.

He doesn’t know that the eyes of the Lord are ten thousand times brighter than the sun,

seeing all the ways of men,

and looking into secret places.

All things were known to him before they were created,

and also after they were completed.

This man will be punished in the streets of the city.

He will be seized where he least expects it.

So also is a wife who leaves her husband,

and produces an heir by another man.

For first, she was disobedient in the law of the Most High.

Second, she trespassed against her own husband.

Third, she played the adulteress in fornication,

and had children by another man.

She shall be brought out into the congregation.

Her punishment will extend to her children.

Her children will not take root.

Her branches will bear no fruit.

She will leave her memory for a curse.

Her reproach won’t be blotted out.

And those who are left behind will know that there is nothing better than the fear of the Lord,

and nothing sweeter than to heed the commandments of the Lord.

### Chapter 24

Wisdom will praise her own soul,

and will proclaim her glory in the midst of her people.

She will open her mouth in the congregation of the Most High,

and proclaim her glory in the presence of his power.

“I came out of the mouth of the Most High,

and covered the earth as a mist.

I lived in high places,

and my throne is in the pillar of the cloud.

Alone I surrounded the circuit of heaven,

and walked in the depth of the abyss.

In the waves of the sea, and in all the earth,

and in every people and nation, I obtained a possession.

With all these I sought rest.

In whose inheritance shall I lodge?

Then the Creator of all things gave me a command.

He who created me made my tent to rest,

and said, ‘Let your dwelling be in Jacob,

and your inheritance in Israel.’

He created me from the beginning, before the ages.

For all ages, I will not cease to exist.

In the holy tabernacle, I ministered before him.

So I was established in Zion.

In the beloved city, likewise he gave me rest.

In Jerusalem was my domain.

I took root in a people that was honored,

even in the portion of the Lord’s own inheritance.

I was exalted like a cedar in Lebanon,

And like a cypress tree on the mountains of Hermon.

I was exalted like a palm tree on the sea shore,

like rose bushes in Jericho,

and like a fair olive tree in the plain.

I was exalted like a plane tree.

Like cinnamon and aspalathus, I have given a scent to perfumes.

Like choice myrrh, I spread abroad a pleasant fragrance,

like galbanum, onycha, stacte,

and as the smell of frankincense in the tabernacle.

Like the terebinth, I stretched out my branches.

My branches are glorious and graceful.

Like the vine, I put forth grace.

My flowers are the fruit of glory and riches.

“Come to me, all you who desire me,

and be filled with my fruits.

For my memory is sweeter than honey,

and my inheritance than the honeycomb.

Those who eat me will be hungry for more.

Those who drink me will be thirsty for more.

He who obeys me will not be ashamed.

Those who work with me will not sin.”

All these things are the book of the covenant of the Most High God,

the law which Moses commanded us for an inheritance for the assemblies of Jacob.

It is he who makes wisdom abundant, as Pishon,

and as Tigris in the days of first fruits.

He makes understanding full as the Euphrates,

and as the Jordan in the days of harvest,

who makes instruction shine forth as the light,

as Gihon in the days of vintage.

The first man didn’t know her perfectly.

In like manner, the last has not explored her.

For her thoughts are filled from the sea,

and her counsels from the great deep.

I came out as a canal stream from a river,

and as an irrigation ditch into a garden.

I said, “I will water my garden,

and will drench my garden bed.”

Behold, my stream became a river,

and my river became a sea.

I will yet bring instruction to light as the morning,

and will make these things clear from far away.

I will continue to pour out teaching like prophecy,

and leave it to all generations.

See that I have not labored for myself only,

but for all those who diligently seek wisdom.

### Chapter 25

I enjoy three things,

and they are beautiful before the Lord and men:

the agreement of kindred,

the friendship of neighbors,

and a woman and her husband who walk together in agreement.

But my soul hates three sorts of people,

and I am greatly offended at their life:

a poor man who is arrogant,

a rich man who is a liar,

and an old fool who is an adulterer.

If you gathered nothing in your youth,

how could you find anything in your old age?

How beautiful a thing is judgment in the gray-haired,

and for elders to know good counsel!

How beautiful is the wisdom of old men,

and understanding and counsel to men who are in honor!

Much experience is the crown of the aged.

Their glory is the fear of the Lord.

There are nine things that I have thought of, and in my heart counted happy,

and the tenth I will utter with my tongue:

a man who has joy with his children,

and a man who lives and sees the fall of his enemies.

Happy is he who dwells with a wife of understanding,

he who has not slipped with his tongue,

and he who has not served a man who is unworthy of him.

Happy is he who has found prudence,

and he who speaks in the ears of those who listen.

How great is he who has found wisdom!

Yet is there none above him who fears the Lord.

The fear of the Lord surpasses all things.

To whom shall he who holds it be likened?

Any wound but a wound of the heart!

Any wickedness but the wickedness of a woman!

Any calamity but a calamity from those who hate me!

Any vengeance but the vengeance of enemies!

There is no venom worse than a snake’s venom.

There is no wrath worse than an enemy’s wrath.

I would rather dwell with a lion and a dragon

than keep house with a wicked woman.

The wickedness of a woman changes her appearance,

and darkens her countenance like that of a bear.

Her husband will sit among his neighbors,

and when he hears it, he sighs bitterly.

All malice is small compared to the malice of a woman.

Let the portion of a sinner fall on her.

As walking up a sandy hill is to the feet of the aged,

so is a wife full of words to a quiet man.

Don’t be ensnared by a woman’s beauty.

Don’t desire a woman for her beauty.

There is anger, impudence, and great reproach

if a woman supports her husband.

A wicked woman is abasement of heart,

sadness of countenance, and a wounded heart.

A woman who won’t make her husband happy

is like hands that hang down, and weak knees.

The beginning of sin came from a woman.

Because of her, we all die.

Don’t give water an outlet,

and don’t give a wicked woman freedom of speech.

If she doesn’t go as you direct,

cut her away from your flesh.

### Chapter 26

Happy is the husband of a good wife.

The number of his days will be doubled.

A faithful wife gives joy to her husband.

He will fulfill his years in peace.

A good wife is a great gift.

She will be given to those who fear the Lord.

Whether a man is rich or poor,

a good heart makes a cheerful face at all times.

Of three things my heart was afraid,

and concerning the fourth kind I made supplication:

The slander of a city, the assembly of a mob, and a false accusation.

All these are more grievous than death.

A grief of heart and sorrow is a woman who is jealous of another woman.

Her tongue-lashing makes it known to all.

A wicked woman is like a chafing yoke.

He who takes hold of her is like one who grasps a scorpion.

A drunken woman causes great wrath.

She will not cover her own shame.

The fornication of a woman is in the lifting up of her eyes;

it will be known by her eyelids.

Keep strict watch on a headstrong daughter,

lest she find liberty for herself, and use it.

Watch out for an impudent eye,

and don’t be surprised if it sins against you.

She will open her mouth like a thirsty traveller,

and drink from every water that is near.

She will sit down at every post,

and open her quiver to any arrow.

The grace of a wife will delight her husband.

Her knowledge will strengthen his bones.

A silent woman is a gift of the Lord.

There is nothing worth so much as a well-instructed soul.

A modest woman is grace upon grace.

There are no scales that can weigh the value of a self-controlled soul.

As the sun when it arises in the highest places of the Lord,

so is the beauty of a good wife in her well-organized home.

As the lamp that shines upon the holy lampstand,

so is the beauty of the face on a well-proportioned body.

As the golden pillars are upon a base of silver,

so are beautiful feet with the breasts of one who is steadfast.

For two things my heart is grieved,

and for the third anger comes upon me:

a warrior who suffers for poverty,

men of understanding who are counted as garbage,

and one who turns back from righteousness to sin—

the Lord will prepare him for the sword!

It is difficult for a merchant to keep himself from wrong doing,

and for a retailer to be acquitted of sin.

### Chapter 27

Many have sinned for profit.

He who seeks to multiply wealth will turn his eye away.

As a nail will stick fast between the joinings of stones,

so sin will thrust itself in between buying and selling.

Unless a person holds on diligently to the fear of the Lord,

his house will be overthrown quickly.

In the shaking of a sieve, the refuse remains,

so does the filth of man in his thoughts.

The furnace tests the potter’s vessels;

so the test of a person is in his thoughts.

The fruit of a tree discloses its cultivation,

so is the utterance of the thought of a person’s heart.

Praise no man before you hear his thoughts,

for this is how people are tested.

If you follow righteousness, you will obtain it,

and put it on like a long robe of glory.

Birds will return to their own kind,

so truth will return to those who practice it.

The lion lies in wait for prey.

So does sin for those who do evil.

The discourse of a godly man is always wise,

but the fool changes like the moon.

Limit your time among people void of understanding,

but persevere among the thoughtful.

The talk of fools is offensive.

Their laughter is wantonly sinful.

Their talk with much swearing makes hair stand upright.

Their strife makes others plug their ears.

The strife of the proud leads to bloodshed.

Their abuse of each other is a grievous thing to hear.

He who reveals secrets destroys trust,

and will not find a close friend.

Love a friend, and keep faith with him;

but if you reveal his secrets,

you shall not follow him;

for as a man has destroyed his enemy,

so you have destroyed the friendship of your neighbor.

As a bird which you have released out of your hand,

so you have let your neighbor go, and you will not catch him again.

Don’t pursue him, for he has gone far away,

and has escaped like a gazelle out of the snare.

For a wound may be bound up, and after abuse there may be reconciliation;

but he who reveals secrets is without hope.

One who winks the eye contrives evil things;

and those who know him will keep their distance.

When you are present, he will speak sweetly,

and will admire your words;

but afterward he will twist his speech

and set a trap in your words.

I have hated many things, but nothing like him.

The Lord will hate him.

One who casts a stone straight up casts it on his own head.

A deceitful blow opens wounds.

He who digs a pit will fall into it.

He who sets a snare will be caught in it.

He who does evil things, they will roll back upon him,

and he will not know where they came from.

Mockery and reproach are from the arrogant.

Vengeance lies in wait for them like a lion.

Those who rejoice at the fall of the godly will be caught in a snare.

Anguish will consume them before they die.

Wrath and anger, these also are abominations.

A sinner will possess them.

### Chapter 28

He who takes vengeance will find vengeance from the Lord,

and he will surely make his sins firm.

Forgive your neighbor the hurt that he has done,

and then your sins will be pardoned when you pray.

Does anyone harbor anger against another

and expect healing from the Lord?

Upon a man like himself he has no mercy,

and does he make supplication for his own sins?

He himself, being flesh, nourishes wrath.

Who will make atonement for his sins?

Remember your last end, and stop enmity.

Remember corruption and death, and be true to the commandments.

Remember the commandments, and don’t be angry with your neighbor.

Remember the covenant of the Highest, and overlook ignorance.

Abstain from strife, and you will diminish your sins,

for a passionate man will kindle strife.

A man who is a sinner will trouble friends

and sow discord among those who are at peace.

As is the fuel of the fire, so it will burn;

and as the stoutness of the strife is, so it will burn.

As is the strength of the man, so will be his wrath;

and as is his wealth, so he will exalt his anger.

A contention begun in haste kindles a fire;

and hasty fighting sheds blood.

If you blow on a spark, it will burn;

and if you spit upon it, it will be quenched.

Both of these come out of your mouth.

Curse the whisperer and double-tongued,

for he has destroyed many who were at peace.

A slanderer has shaken many,

and dispersed them from nation to nation.

It has pulled down strong cities

and overthrown the houses of great men.

A slanderer has cast out brave women

and deprived them of their labors.

He who listens to it will not find rest,

nor will he live quietly.

The stroke of a whip makes a mark in the flesh,

but the stroke of a tongue will break bones.

Many have fallen by the edge of the sword,

yet not so many as those who have fallen because of the tongue.

Happy is he who is sheltered from it,

who has not passed through its wrath,

who has not drawn its yoke,

and has not been bound with its bands.

For its yoke is a yoke of iron,

and its bands are bands of brass.

Its death is an evil death,

and Hades is better than it.

It will not have rule over godly men.

They will not be burned in its flame.

Those who forsake the Lord will fall into it.

It will burn among them, and won’t be quenched.

It will be sent against them like a lion.

It will destroy them like a leopard.

As you hedge your possession about with thorns,

and secure your silver and your gold,

so make a balance and a weight for your words,

and make a door and a bar for your mouth.

Take heed lest you slip with it,

lest you fall before one who lies in wait.

### Chapter 29

He who shows mercy will lend to his neighbor.

He who strengthens him with his hand keeps the commandments.

Lend to your neighbor in time of his need.

Repay your neighbor on time.

Confirm your word, and keep faith with him;

and at all seasons you will find what you need.

Many have considered a loan to be a windfall,

and have given trouble to those who helped them.

Until he has received, he will kiss a man’s hands.

For his neighbor’s money he will speak submissively.

Then when payment is due, he will prolong the time,

return excuses, and complain about the season.

If he prevails, the creditor will hardly receive half;

and he will count it as a windfall.

If not, he has deprived him of his money,

and he has gotten him for an enemy without cause.

He will pay him with cursing and railing.

Instead of honor, he will pay him disgrace.

Many on account of fraud have turned away.

They are afraid of being defrauded for nothing.

However be patient with a man in poor estate.

Don’t keep him waiting for your alms.

Help a poor man for the commandment’s sake.

According to his need don’t send him empty away.

Lose your money for a brother and a friend.

Don’t let it rust under a stone and be lost.

Allocate your treasure according to the commandments of the Most High

and it will profit you more than gold.

Store up almsgiving in your store-chambers

and it will deliver you out of all affliction.

It will fight for you against your enemy

better than a mighty shield and a ponderous spear.

A good man will be surety for his neighbor.

He who has lost shame will fail him.

Don’t forget the kindness of your guarantor,

for he has given his life for you.

A sinner will waste the property of his guarantor.

He who is thankless will fail him who delivered him.

Being surety has undone many who were prospering

and shaken them as a wave of the sea.

It has driven mighty men from their homes.

They wandered among foreign nations.

A sinner who falls into suretiship and undertakes contracts for work

will fall into lawsuits.

Help your neighbor according to your power,

and be careful not to fall yourself.

The essentials of life are water, bread,

a garment, and a house for privacy.

Better is the life of a poor man under a shelter of logs

than sumptuous fare in another man’s house.

With little or with much, be well satisfied.

It is a miserable life to go from house to house.

Where you are a guest, you dare not open your mouth.

You will entertain, serve drinks, and have no thanks.

In addition to this, you will hear bitter words.

“Come here, you sojourner, set a table,

and if you have anything in your hand, feed me with it.”

“Leave, you sojourner, for an honored guest is here.

My brother has come to be my guest. I need my house.”

These things are grievous to a man of understanding:

The scolding about lodging and the insults of creditors.

### Chapter 30

He who loves his son will continue to lay stripes upon him,

that he may have joy from him in the end.

He who chastises his son will have profit from him,

and will brag about him among his acquaintances.

He who teaches his son will provoke his enemy to jealousy.

Before friends, he will rejoice in him.

His father dies, and is as though he had not died;

for he has left one behind him like himself.

In his life, he saw his son and rejoiced.

When he died, it was without regret.

He left behind him an avenger against his enemies,

and one to repay kindness to his friends.

He who makes too much of his son will bind up his wounds.

His heart will be troubled at every cry.

An unbroken horse becomes stubborn.

An unrestrained son becomes headstrong.

Pamper your child, and he will make you afraid.

Play with him, and he will grieve you.

Don’t laugh with him, lest you have sorrow with him,

and you gnash your teeth in the end.

Give him no liberty in his youth,

and don’t ignore his follies.

Bow down his neck in his youth,

and beat him on the sides while he is a child,

lest he become stubborn, and be disobedient to you,

and there be sorrow to your soul.

Chastise your son, and give him work,

lest his shameless behavior be an offense to you.

Better is a poor man who is healthy and fit,

than a rich man who is afflicted in his body.

Health and fitness are better than all gold,

and a strong body better than wealth without measure.

There is no wealth better than health of body.

There is no gladness above the joy of the heart.

Death is better than a bitter life,

and eternal rest than a continual sickness.

Good things poured out upon a mouth that is closed

are like food offerings laid upon a grave.

What does an offering profit an idol?

For it can’t eat or smell.

So is he who is punished by the Lord,

seeing with his eyes and groaning,

like a eunuch embracing a virgin and groaning.

Don’t give your soul to sorrow.

Don’t afflict yourself deliberately.

Gladness of heart is the life of a man.

Cheerfulness of a man lengthens his days.

Love your own soul, and comfort your heart.

Remove sorrow far from you,

for sorrow has destroyed many,

and there is no profit in it.

Envy and wrath shorten life.

Anxiety brings old age before its time.

Those who are cheerful and merry

will benefit from their food.

### Chapter 31

Wakefulness that comes from riches consumes the flesh,

and anxiety about it takes away sleep.

Wakeful anxiety will crave slumber.

In a severe disease, sleep will be broken.

A rich man toils in gathering money together.

When he rests, he is filled with his good things.

A poor man toils in lack of substance.

When he rests, he becomes needy.

He who loves gold won’t be justified.

He who follows destruction will himself have his fill of it.

Many have been given over to ruin for the sake of gold.

Their destruction meets them face to face.

It is a stumbling block to those who sacrifice to it.

Every fool will be taken by it.

Blessed is the rich person who is found blameless,

and who doesn’t go after gold.

Who is he, that we may call him blessed?

For he has done wonderful things among his people.

Who has been tried by it, and found perfect?

Then let him boast.

Who has had the power to transgress, and has not transgressed?

And to do evil, and has not done it?

His prosperity will be made sure.

The congregation will proclaim his alms.

Do you sit at a great table? Don’t be greedy there.

Don’t say, “There is a lot of food on it!”

Remember that a greedy eye is a wicked thing.

What has been created more greedy than an eye?

Therefore it sheds tears from every face.

Don’t stretch your hand wherever it looks.

Don’t thrust yourself with it into the dish.

Consider your neighbor’s feelings by your own.

Be discreet in every point.

Eat like a human being those things which are set before you.

Don’t eat greedily, lest you be hated.

Be first to stop for manners’ sake.

Don’t be insatiable, lest you offend.

And if you sit among many,

Don’t reach out your hand before them.

How sufficient to a well-mannered man is a very little.

He doesn’t breathe heavily in his bed.

Healthy sleep comes from moderate eating.

He rises early, and his wits are with him.

The pain of wakefulness, colic,

and griping are with an insatiable man.

And if you have been forced to eat,

rise up in the middle of it, and you shall have rest.

Hear me, my son, and don’t despise me,

and in the end you will appreciate my words.

In all your works be skillful,

and no disease will come to you.

People bless him who is liberal with his food.

The testimony of his excellence will be believed.

The city will murmur at him who is a stingy with his food.

The testimony of his stinginess will be accurate.

Don’t show yourself valiant in wine,

for wine has destroyed many.

The furnace tests the temper of steel by dipping;

so does wine test hearts in the quarreling of the proud.

Wine is as good as life to men,

if you drink it in moderation.

What life is there to a man who is without wine?

It has been created to make men glad.

Wine drunk in season and in moderation

is joy of heart and gladness of soul:

Wine drunk excessively is bitterness of soul,

with provocation and conflict.

Drunkenness increases the rage of a fool to his hurt.

It diminishes strength and adds wounds.

Don’t rebuke your neighbor at a banquet of wine.

Don’t despise him in his mirth.

Don’t speak a word of reproach to him.

Don’t distress him by making demands of him.

### Chapter 32

Have they made you ruler of a feast?

Don’t be lifted up.

Be among them as one of them.

Take care of them first, and then sit down.

And when you have done all your duties, take your place,

that you may be gladdened on their account,

and receive a wreath for your good service.

Speak, you who are older, for it’s your right, but with sound knowledge;

and don’t interrupt the music.

Don’t pour out talk where there is a performance of music.

Don’t display your wisdom at the wrong time.

As a ruby signet in a setting of gold,

so is a music concert at a wine banquet.

As an emerald signet in a work of gold,

so is musical melody with pleasant wine.

Speak, young man, if you are obliged to,

but no more than twice, and only if asked.

Sum up your speech, many things in few words.

Be as one who knows and yet holds his tongue.

When among great men, don’t behave as their equal.

When another is speaking, don’t babble.

Lightning speeds before thunder.

Approval goes before one who is modest.

Rise up in good time, and don’t be last.

Go home quickly and don’t loiter

Amuse yourself there and do what is in your heart.

Don’t sin by proud speech.

For these things bless your Maker,

who gives you to drink freely of his good things.

He who fears the Lord will receive discipline.

Those who seek him early will find favor.

He who seeks the law shall be filled with it,

but the hypocrite will stumble at it.

Those who fear the Lord will find true judgment,

and will kindle righteous acts like a light.

A sinful man shuns reproof,

and will find a judgment according to his will.

A sensible person won’t neglect a thought.

An insolent and proud man won’t crouch in fear,

even after he has done a thing by himself without counsel.

Do nothing without counsel,

but when you have acted, don’t regret it.

Don’t go in a way of conflict.

Don’t stumble in stony places.

Don’t be overconfident on a smooth road.

Beware of your own children.

In every work guard your own soul,

for this is the keeping of the commandments.

He who believes the law gives heed to the commandment.

He who trusts in the Lord will suffer no loss.

### Chapter 33

No evil will happen to him who fears the Lord,

but in trials once and again he will deliver him.

A wise man will not hate the law,

but he who is a hypocrite about it is like a boat in a storm.

A man of understanding will put his trust in the law.

And the law is faithful to him, as when one asks a divine oracle.

Prepare your speech, and so you will be heard.

Bind up instruction, and make your answer.

The heart of a fool is like a cartwheel.

His thoughts are like a rolling axle.

A stallion horse is like a mocking friend.

He neighs under every one who sits upon him.

Why does one day excel another,

when all the light of every day in the year is from the sun?

They were distinguished by the Lord’s knowledge,

and he varied seasons and feasts.

Some of them he exalted and hallowed,

and some of them he has made ordinary days.

And all men are from the ground.

Adam was created from dust.

In the abundance of his knowledge the Lord distinguished them,

and made their ways different.

Some of them he blessed and exalted,

and some of them he made holy and brought near to himself.

Some of them he cursed and brought low,

and overthrew them from their place.

As the clay of the potter in his hand,

all his ways are according to his good pleasure,

so men are in the hand of him who made them,

to render to them according to his judgment.

Good is the opposite of evil,

and life is the opposite of death;

so the sinner is the opposite of the godly.

Look upon all the works of the Most High like this,

they come in pairs, one against another.

I was the last on watch,

like one who gleans after the grape gatherers.

By the Lord’s blessing I arrived before them,

and filled my winepress like one who gathers grapes.

Consider that I labored not for myself alone,

but for all those who seek instruction.

Hear me, you great men of the people,

and listen with your ears, you rulers of the congregation.

To son and wife, to brother and friend,

don’t give power over yourself while you live,

and don’t give your goods to another,

lest you regret it and must ask for them.

While you still live and breath is in you,

don’t give yourself over to anybody.

For it is better that your children should ask from you

than that you should look to the hand of your children.

Excel in all your works.

Don’t bring a stain on your honor.

In the day that you end the days of your life,

in the time of death, distribute your inheritance.

Fodder, a stick, and burdens are for a donkey.

Bread, discipline, and work are for a servant.

Set your slave to work, and you will find rest.

Leave his hands idle, and he will seek liberty.

Yoke and thong will bow the neck.

For an evil slave there are racks and tortures.

Send him to labor, that he not be idle,

for idleness teaches much mischief.

Set him to work, as is fit for him.

If he doesn’t obey, make his fetters heavy.

Don’t be excessive toward any.

Do nothing unjust.

If you have a slave, treat him like yourself,

because you have bought him with blood.

If you have a slave, treat him like yourself.

For like your own soul, you will need him.

If you treat him ill, and he departs and runs away,

which way will you go to seek him?

### Chapter 34

Vain and false hopes are for a man void of understanding.

Dreams give wings to fools.

As one who grasps at a shadow and follows after the wind,

so is he who sets his mind on dreams.

The vision of dreams is a reflection,

the likeness of a face near a face.

From an unclean thing what can be cleansed?

From that which is false what can be true?

Divinations, and soothsayings, and dreams, are vain.

The heart has fantasies like a woman in labor.

If they are not sent in a visitation from the Most High,

don’t give your heart to them.

For dreams have led many astray.

They have failed by putting their hope in them.

Without lying the law will be fulfilled.

Wisdom is complete in a faithful mouth.

A well-instructed man knows many things.

He who has much experience will declare understanding.

He who has no experience knows few things.

But he who has traveled increases cleverness.

I have seen many things in my travels.

My understanding is more than my words.

I was often in danger even to death.

I was preserved because of these experiences.

The spirit of those who fear the Lord will live,

for their hope is in him who saves them.

Whoever fears the Lord won’t be afraid, and won’t be a coward,

for he is his hope.

Blessed is the soul of him who fears the Lord.

To whom does he give heed? Who is his support?

The eyes of the Lord are on those who love him,

a mighty protection and strong support,

a cover from the hot blast, a shade from the noonday sun,

a guard from stumbling, and a help from falling.

He raises up the soul, and enlightens the eyes.

He gives health, life, and blessing.

He who sacrifices a thing wrongfully gotten, his offering is made in mockery.

The mockeries of wicked men are not acceptable.

The Most High has no pleasure in the offerings of the ungodly,

Neither is he pacified for sins by the multitude of sacrifices.

Like one who kills a son before his father’s eyes

is he who brings a sacrifice from the goods of the poor.

The bread of the needy is the life of the poor.

He who deprives him of it is a man of blood.

Like one who murders his neighbor is he who takes away his living.

Like a shedder of blood is he who deprives a hireling of his hire.

When one builds, and another pulls down,

what profit do they have but toil?

When one prays, and another curses,

whose voice will the Lord listen to?

He who washes himself after touching a dead body, and touches it again,

what does he gain by his washing?

Even so a man fasting for his sins,

and going again, and doing the same,

who will listen to his prayer?

What profit does he have in his humiliation?

### Chapter 35

He who keeps the law multiplies offerings.

He who heeds the commandments sacrifices a peace offering.

He who returns a kindness offers fine flour.

He who gives alms sacrifices a thank offering.

To depart from wickedness pleases the Lord.

To depart from unrighteousness is an atoning sacrifice.

See that you don’t appear in the presence of the Lord empty.

For all these things are done because of the commandment.

The offering of the righteous enriches the altar.

The sweet fragrance of it is before the Most High.

The sacrifice of a righteous man is acceptable.

It won’t be forgotten.

Glorify the Lord with generosity.

Don’t reduce the first fruits of your hands.

In every gift show a cheerful countenance,

And dedicate your tithe with gladness.

Give to the Most High according as he has given.

As your hand has found, give generously.

For the Lord repays,

and he will repay you sevenfold.

Don’t plan to bribe him with gifts, for he will not receive them.

Don’t set your mind on an unrighteous sacrifice,

For the Lord is the judge,

and with him is no respect of persons.

He won’t accept any person against a poor man.

He will listen to the prayer of him who is wronged.

He will in no way despise the supplication of the fatherless

or the widow, when she pours out her tale.

Don’t the tears of the widow run down her cheek?

Isn’t her cry against him who has caused them to fall?

He who serves God according to his good pleasure will be accepted.

His supplication will reach to the clouds.

The prayer of the humble pierces the clouds.

until it comes near, he will not be comforted.

He won’t depart until the Most High visits

and he judges righteously and executes judgment.

And the Lord will not be slack, neither will he be patient toward them,

until he has crushed the loins of the unmerciful.

He will repay vengeance to the heathen

until he has taken away the multitude of the arrogant

and broken in pieces the sceptres of the unrighteous,

until he has rendered to every man according to his deeds,

and repaid the works of men according to their plans,

until he has judged the cause of his people,

and he will make them rejoice in his mercy.

Mercy is as welcome in the time of his affliction,

as clouds of rain in the time of drought.

### Chapter 36

Have mercy upon us, O Lord the God of all, and look at us with favor;

and send your fear upon all the nations.

Lift up your hand against the foreign nations

and let them see your mighty power.

As you showed your holiness in us before them,

so be magnified in them before us.

Let them know you, as we also have known you,

that there is no God but only you, O God.

Show new signs, and work various wonders.

Glorify your hand and your right arm.

Raise up indignation and pour out wrath.

Take away the adversary and destroy the enemy.

Hasten the time and remember your oath.

Let them declare your mighty works.

Let him who escapes be devoured by raging fire.

May those who harm your people find destruction.

Crush the heads of the rulers of the enemies

who say, “There is no one but ourselves.”

Gather all the tribes of Jacob together,

and take them for your inheritance, as from the beginning.

O Lord, have mercy upon the people that is called by your name,

and upon Israel, whom you likened to a firstborn.

Have compassion upon the city of your sanctuary,

Jerusalem, the place of your rest.

Fill Zion. Exalt your oracles

and fill your people with your glory.

Give testimony to those who were your creatures in the beginning,

and fulfill the prophecies that have been spoken in your name.

Reward those who wait for you,

and men will put their trust in your prophets.

Listen, O Lord, to the prayer of your servants,

according to the blessing of Aaron concerning your people;

and all those who are on the earth will know

that you are the Lord, the eternal God.

The belly will eat any food,

but one food is better than another.

The mouth tastes meats taken in hunting,

so does an understanding heart detect false speech.

A contrary heart will cause heaviness.

A man of experience will pay him back.

A woman will receive any man,

but one daughter is better than another.

The beauty of a woman cheers the countenance.

A man desires nothing more.

If kindness and humility are on her tongue,

her husband is not like other sons of men.

He who gets a wife gets his richest treasure,

a help meet for him and a pillar of support.

Where no hedge is, the property will be plundered.

He who has no wife will mourn as he wanders.

For who would trust a nimble robber who skips from city to city?

Even so, who would trust a man who has no nest, and lodges wherever he finds himself at nightfall?

### Chapter 37

Every friend will say, “I also am his friend”;

but there is a friend which is only a friend in name.

Isn’t there a grief in it even to death

when a companion and friend is turned into an enemy?

O wicked imagination, why were you formed

to cover the dry land with deceit?

There is a companion who rejoices in the gladness of a friend,

but in time of affliction will be against him.

There is a companion who for the belly’s sake labors with his friend,

yet in the face of battle will carry his buckler.

Don’t forget a friend in your soul.

Don’t be unmindful of him in your riches.

Every counselor extols counsel,

but some give counsel in their own interest.

Let your soul beware of a counselor,

and know in advance what is his interest

(for he will take counsel for himself),

lest he cast the lot against you,

and say to you, “Your way is good.”

Then he will stand near you, to see what will happen to you.

Don’t take counsel with one who looks askance at you.

Hide your counsel from those who are jealous of you.

Don’t consult with a woman about her rival,

with a coward about war,

with a merchant about business,

with a buyer about selling,

with an envious man about thankfulness,

with an unmerciful man about kindliness,

with a sluggard about any kind of work,

with a hireling in your house about finishing his work,

or with an idle servant about much business.

Pay no attention to these in any matter of counsel.

But rather be continually with a godly man,

whom you know to be a keeper of the commandments,

who in his soul is as your own soul,

and who will grieve with you, if you fail.

Make the counsel of your heart stand,

for there is no one more faithful to you than it.

For a man’s soul is sometimes inclined to inform him

better than seven watchmen who sit on high on a watch-tower.

Above all this ask the Most High

that he may direct your way in truth.

Let reason be the beginning of every work.

Let counsel go before every action.

As a token of the changing of the heart,

four kinds of things rise up:

good and evil, life and death.

That which rules over them continually is the tongue.

There is one who is clever and the instructor of many,

and yet is unprofitable to his own soul.

There is one who is subtle in words, and is hated.

He will be destitute of all food.

For grace was not given to him from the Lord,

because he is deprived of all wisdom.

There is one who is wise to his own soul;

and the fruits of his understanding are trustworthy in the mouth.

A wise man will instruct his own people.

The fruits of his understanding are trustworthy.

A wise man will be filled with blessing.

All those who see him will call him happy.

The life of a man is counted by days.

The days of Israel are innumerable.

The wise man will inherit confidence among his people.

His name will live forever.

My son, test your soul in your life.

See what is evil for it, and don’t give in to it.

For not all things are profitable for all men.

Not every soul has pleasure in everything.

Don’t be insatiable in any luxury.

Don’t be greedy in the things that you eat.

For overeating brings disease,

and gluttony causes nausea.

Because of gluttony, many have perished,

but he who takes heed shall prolong his life.

### Chapter 38

Honor a physician according to your need with the honors due to him,

for truly the Lord has created him.

For healing comes from the Most High,

and he shall receive a gift from the king.

The skill of the physician will lift up his head.

He will be admired in the sight of great men.

The Lord created medicines out of the earth.

A prudent man will not despise them.

Wasn’t water made sweet with wood,

that its power might be known?

He gave men skill

that he might be glorified in his marvelous works.

With them he heals

and takes away pain.

With these, the pharmacist makes a mixture.

God’s works won’t be brought to an end.

From him, peace is upon the face of the earth.

My son, in your sickness don’t be negligent,

but pray to the Lord, and he will heal you.

Put away wrong doing, and direct your hands in righteousness.

Cleanse your heart from all sin.

Give a sweet savor and a memorial of fine flour,

and pour oil on your offering, according to your means.

Then give place to the physician, for truly the Lord has created him.

Don’t let him leave you, for you need him.

There is a time when in recovery is in their hands.

For they also shall ask the Lord

to prosper them in diagnosis and in healing for the maintenance of life.

He who sins before his Maker,

let him fall into the hands of the physician.

My son, let your tears fall over the dead,

and as one who suffers grievously, begin lamentation.

Wind up his body with due honor.

Don’t neglect his burial.

Make bitter weeping and make passionate wailing.

Let your mourning be according to his merit,

for one day or two, lest you be spoken evil of;

and so be comforted for your sorrow.

For from sorrow comes death.

Sorrow of heart saps one’s strength.

In calamity, sorrow also remains.

A poor man’s life is grievous to the heart.

Don’t give your heart to sorrow.

Put it away, remembering the end.

Don’t forget it, for there is no returning again.

You do him no good, and you would harm yourself.

Remember his end, for so also will yours be:

yesterday for me, and today for you.

When the dead is at rest, let his remembrance rest.

Be comforted for him when his spirit departs from him.

The wisdom of the scribe comes by the opportunity of leisure.

He who has little business can become wise.

How could he become wise who holds the plow,

who glories in the shaft of the goad,

who drives oxen and is occupied in their labors,

and who mostly talks about bulls?

He will set his heart upon turning his furrows.

His lack of sleep is to give his heifers their fodder.

So is every craftsman and master artisan

who passes his time by night as by day,

those who cut engravings of signets.

His diligence is to make great variety.

He sets his heart to preserve likeness in his portraiture,

and is careful to finish his work.

So too is the smith sitting by the anvil

and considering the unwrought iron.

The smoke of the fire will waste his flesh.

He toils in the heat of the furnace.

The noise of the hammer deafens his ear.

His eyes are upon the pattern of the object.

He will set his heart upon perfecting his works.

He will be careful to adorn them perfectly.

So is the potter sitting at his work

and turning the wheel around with his feet,

who is always anxiously set at his work.

He produces his handiwork in quantity.

He will fashion the clay with his arm

and will bend its strength in front of his feet.

He will apply his heart to finish the glazing.

He will be careful to clean the kiln.

All these put their trust in their hands.

Each becomes skillful in his own work.

Without these no city would be inhabited.

Men wouldn’t reside as foreigners or walk up and down there.

They won’t be sought for in the council of the people.

They won’t mount on high in the assembly.

They won’t sit on the seat of the judge.

They won’t understand the covenant of judgment.

Neither will they declare instruction and judgment.

They won’t be found where parables are.

But they will maintain the fabric of the age.

Their prayer is in the handiwork of their craft.

### Chapter 39

Not so he who has applied his soul

and meditates in the law of the Most High.

He will seek out the wisdom of all the ancients

and will be occupied with prophecies.

He will keep the sayings of the men of renown

and will enter in amidst the subtleties of parables.

He will seek out the hidden meaning of proverbs

and be conversant in the dark sayings of parables.

He will serve among great men

and appear before him who rules.

He will travel through the land of foreign nations,

for he has learned what is good and evil among men.

He will apply his heart to return early to the Lord who made him,

and will make supplication before the Most High,

and will open his mouth in prayer,

and will ask for pardon for his sins.

If the great Lord wills,

he will be filled with the spirit of understanding;

he will pour forth the words of his wisdom

and in prayer give thanks to the Lord.

He will direct his counsel and knowledge,

and he will meditate in his secrets.

He will show the instruction which he has been taught

and will glory in the law of the covenant of the Lord.

Many will commend his understanding.

So long as the world endures, it won’t be blotted out.

His memory won’t depart.

His name will live from generation to generation.

Nations will declare his wisdom.

The congregation will proclaim his praise.

If he continues, he will leave a greater name than a thousand.

If he finally rests, it is enough for him.

Yet more I will utter, which I have thought about.

I am filled like the full moon.

Listen to me, you holy children,

and bud forth like a rose growing by a brook of water.

Give a sweet fragrance like frankincense.

Put forth flowers like a lily.

Scatter a sweet smell and sing a song of praise.

Bless the Lord for all his works!

Magnify his name

and give utterance to his praise

with the songs on your lips and with harps!

Say this when you utter his praise:

All the works of the Lord are exceedingly good,

and every command will be done in its time.

No one can say, “What is this?” “Why is that?”

for at the proper time they will all be sought out.

At his word, the waters stood as a heap,

as did the reservoirs of water at the word of his mouth.

At his command all his good pleasure is fulfilled.

There is no one who can hinder his salvation.

The works of all flesh are before him.

It’s impossible to be hidden from his eyes.

He sees from everlasting to everlasting.

There is nothing too wonderful for him.

No one can say, “What is this?” “Why is that?”

for all things are created for their own uses.

His blessing covered the dry land as a river

and saturated it as a flood.

As he has made the waters salty,

so the heathen will inherit his wrath.

His ways are plain to the holy.

They are stumbling blocks to the wicked.

Good things are created from the beginning for the good.

So are evil things for sinners.

The main things necessary for the life of man

are water, fire, iron, salt,

wheat flour, and honey, milk,

the blood of the grape, oil, and clothing.

All these things are for good to the godly,

but for sinners, they will be turned into evils.

There are winds that are created for vengeance,

and in their fury they lay on their scourges heavily.

In the time of reckoning, they pour out their strength,

and will appease the wrath of him who made them.

Fire, hail, famine, and death—

all these are created for vengeance—

wild beasts’ teeth, scorpions, adders,

and a sword punishing the ungodly to destruction.

They will rejoice in his commandment,

and will be made ready upon earth when needed.

In their seasons, they won’t disobey his command.

Therefore from the beginning I was convinced,

and I thought it through and left it in writing:

All the works of the Lord are good.

He will supply every need in its time.

No one can say, “This is worse than that,”

for they will all be well approved in their time.

Now with all your hearts and voices, sing praises

and bless the Lord’s name!

### Chapter 40

Great travail is created for every man.

A heavy yoke is upon the sons of Adam,

from the day of their coming forth from their mother’s womb,

until the day for their burial in the mother of all things.

The expectation of things to come, and the day of death,

trouble their thoughts, and cause fear in their hearts.

From him who sits on a throne of glory,

even to him who is humbled in earth and ashes,

from him who wears purple and a crown,

even to him who is clothed in burlap,

there is wrath, jealousy, trouble, unrest,

fear of death, anger, and strife.

In the time of rest upon his bed,

his night sleep changes his knowledge.

He gets little or no rest,

and afterward in his sleep, as in a day of keeping watch,

he is troubled in the vision of his heart,

as one who has escaped from the front of battle.

In the very time of his deliverance, he awakens,

and marvels that the fear is nothing.

To all creatures, human and animal,

and upon sinners sevenfold more,

come death, bloodshed, strife, sword,

calamities, famine, suffering, and plague.

All these things were created for the wicked,

and because of them the flood came.

All things that are of the earth turn to the earth again.

All things that are of the waters return into the sea.

All bribery and injustice will be blotted out.

Good faith will stand forever.

The goods of the unjust will be dried up like a river,

and like a great thunder in rain will go off in noise.

In opening his hands, a man will be made glad;

so lawbreakers will utterly fail.

The children of the ungodly won’t grow many branches,

and are as unhealthy roots on a sheer rock.

The reeds by every water or river bank

will be plucked up before all grass.

Kindness is like a garden of blessings.

Almsgiving endures forever.

The life of one who labors and is content will be made sweet.

He who finds a treasure is better than both.

Children and the building of a city establish a name.

A blameless wife is better than both.

Wine and music rejoice the heart.

The love of wisdom is better than both.

The pipe and the lute make pleasant melody.

A pleasant tongue is better than both.

Your eye desires grace and beauty,

but the green shoots of grain more than both.

A friend and a companion is always welcome,

and a wife with her husband is better than both.

Relatives and helpers are for a time of affliction,

but almsgiving rescues better than both.

Gold and silver will make the foot stand sure,

and counsel is esteemed better than both.

Riches and strength will lift up the heart.

The fear of the Lord is better than both.

There is nothing lacking in the fear of the Lord.

In it, there is no need to seek help.

The fear of the Lord is like a garden of blessing

and covers a man more than any glory.

My son, don’t lead a beggar’s life.

It is better to die than to beg.

A man who looks to the table of another,

his life is not to be considered a life.

He will pollute his soul with another person’s food,

but a wise and well-instructed person will beware of that.

Begging will be sweet in the mouth of the shameless,

but it kindles a fire in his belly.

### Chapter 41

O death, how bitter is the memory of you to a man who is at peace in his possessions,

to the man who has nothing to distract him and has prosperity in all things,

and who still has strength to enjoy food!

O death, your sentence is acceptable to a man who is needy and who fails in strength,

who is in extreme old age, is distracted about all things,

is perverse, and has lost patience!

Don’t be afraid of the sentence of death.

Remember those who have been before you and who come after.

This is the sentence from the Lord over all flesh.

And why do you refuse when it is the good pleasure of the Most High?

Whether life lasts ten, or a hundred, or a thousand years,

there is no inquiry about life in Hades.

The children of sinners are abominable children

and they frequent the dwellings of the ungodly.

The inheritance of sinners’ children will perish

and with their posterity will be a perpetual disgrace.

Children will complain of an ungodly father,

because they suffer disgrace because of him.

Woe to you, ungodly men,

who have forsaken the law of the Most High God!

If you are born, you will be born to a curse.

If you die, a curse will be your portion.

All things that are of the earth will go back to the earth;

so the ungodly will go from a curse to perdition.

The mourning of men is about their bodies;

but the evil name of sinners will be blotted out.

Have regard for your name,

for it continues with you longer than a thousand great treasures of gold.

A good life has its number of days,

but a good name continues forever.

My children, follow instruction in peace.

But wisdom that is hidden and a treasure that is not seen,

what benefit is in them both?

Better is a man who hides his foolishness

than a man who hides his wisdom.

Therefore show respect for my words;

for it is not good to retain every kind of shame.

Not everything is approved by all in good faith.

Be ashamed of sexual immorality before father and mother,

of a lie before a prince and a mighty man,

of an offense before a judge and ruler,

of iniquity before the congregation and the people,

of unjust dealing before a partner and friend,

and of theft in the place where you sojourn.

Be ashamed in regard of the truth of God and his covenant,

of leaning on your elbow at dinner,

of contemptuous behavior in the matter of giving and taking,

of silence before those who greet you,

of looking at a woman who is a prostitute,

of turning away your face from a kinsman,

of taking away a portion or a gift,

of gazing at a woman who has a husband,

of meddling with his maid—and don’t come near her bed,

of abusive speech to friends—and after you have given, don’t insult,

of repeating and speaking what you have heard,

and of revealing of secrets.

So you will be ashamed of the right things

and find favor in the sight of every man.

### Chapter 42

Don’t be ashamed of these things,

and don’t sin to save face:

of the law of the Most High and his covenant,

of judgment to do justice to the ungodly,

of reckoning with a partner and with travellers,

of a gift from the inheritance of friends,

of exactness of scales and weights,

of getting much or little,

of bargaining dealing with merchants,

of frequent correction of children,

and of making the back of an evil slave to bleed.

A seal is good where an evil wife is.

Where there are many hands, lock things up.

Whatever you hand over, let it be by number and weight.

In giving and receiving, let all be in writing.

Don’t be ashamed to instruct the unwise and foolish,

and one of extreme old age who contends with those who are young.

So you will be well instructed indeed

and approved in the sight of every living man.

A daughter is a secret cause of wakefulness to a father.

Care for her takes away sleep—

in her youth, lest she pass the flower of her age;

when she is married, lest she should be hated;

in her virginity, lest she should be defiled and be with child in her father’s house;

when she has a husband, lest she should transgress;

and when she is married, lest she should be barren.

Keep a strict watch over a headstrong daughter,

lest she make you a laughingstock to your enemies,

a byword in the city and notorious among the people,

and shame you in public.

Don’t gaze at every beautiful body.

Don’t sit in the midst of women.

For from garments comes a moth,

and from a woman comes a woman’s wickedness.

Better is the wickedness of a man than a pleasant woman,

a woman who puts you to shame and disgrace.

I will make mention now of the works of the Lord,

and will declare the things that I have seen.

The Lord’s works are in his words.

The sun that gives light looks at all things.

The Lord’s work is full of his glory.

The Lord has not given power to the saints to declare all his marvelous works,

which the Almighty Lord firmly settled,

that the universe might be established in his glory.

He searches out the deep and the heart.

He has understanding of their secrets.

For the Most High knows all knowledge.

He sees the signs of the world.

He declares the things that are past and the things that shall be,

and reveals the traces of hidden things.

No thought escapes him.

There is not a word hidden from him.

He has ordered the mighty works of his wisdom.

He is from everlasting to everlasting.

Nothing has been added to them, nor diminished from them.

He had no need of any counselor.

How desirable are all his works!

One may see this even in a spark.

All these things live and remain forever in all manner of uses.

They are all obedient.

All things are in pairs, one opposite the other.

He has made nothing imperfect.

One thing establishes the good things of another.

Who could ever see enough of his glory?

### Chapter 43

The pride of the heavenly heights is the clear sky,

the appearance of heaven, in the spectacle of its glory.

The sun, when it appears, bringing tidings as it rises,

is a marvelous instrument, the work of the Most High.

At noon, it dries up the land.

Who can stand against its burning heat?

A man tending a furnace is in burning heat,

but the sun three times more, burning up the mountains,

breathing out fiery vapors,

and sending out bright beams, it blinds the eyes.

Great is the Lord who made it.

At his word, he hastens on its course.

The moon marks the changing seasons,

declares times, and is a sign for the world.

From the moon is the sign of feast days,

a light that wanes when it completes its course.

The month is called after its name,

increasing wonderfully in its changing—

an instrument of the army on high,

shining in the structure of heaven,

the beauty of heaven, the glory of the stars,

an ornament giving light in the highest places of the Lord.

At the word of the Holy One, they will stand in due order.

They won’t faint in their watches.

Look at the rainbow, and praise him who made it.

It is exceedingly beautiful in its brightness.

It encircles the sky with its glorious circle.

The hands of the Most High have stretched it out.

By his commandment, he makes the snow fall

and swiftly sends the lightnings of his judgment.

Therefore the storehouses are opened,

and clouds fly out like birds.

By his mighty power, he makes the clouds strong

and the hailstones are broken in pieces.

At his appearing, the mountains will be shaken.

At his will, the south wind will blow.

The voice of his thunder rebukes the earth.

So does the northern storm and the whirlwind.

Like birds flying down, he sprinkles the snow.

It falls down like the lighting of locusts.

The eye is dazzled at the beauty of its whiteness.

The heart is amazed as it falls.

He also pours out frost on the earth like salt.

When it is freezes, it has points like thorns.

The cold north wind blows

and ice freezes on the water.

It settles on every pool of water.

The water puts it on like it was a breastplate.

It will devour the mountains, burn up the wilderness,

and consume the green grass like fire.

A mist coming speedily heals all things.

A dew coming after heat brings cheerfulness.

By his counsel, he has calmed the deep

and planted islands in it.

Those who sail on the sea tell of its dangers.

We marvel when we hear it with our ears.

There are also those strange and wondrous works in it—

variety of all that has life and the huge creatures of the sea.

Because of him, his messengers succeed.

By his word, all things hold together.

We may say many things, but couldn’t say enough.

The summary of our words is, “He is everything!”

How could we have strength to glorify him?

For he is himself the greater than all his works.

The Lord is awesome and exceedingly great!

His power is marvelous!

Glorify the Lord and exalt him as much as you can!

For even yet, he will surpass that.

When you exalt him, summon your full strength.

Don’t be weary, because you can’t praise him enough.

Who has seen him, that he may describe him?

Who can magnify him as he is?

Many things greater than these are hidden,

for we have seen just a few of his works.

For the Lord made all things.

He gave wisdom to the godly.

### Chapter 44

Let us now praise famous men,

our ancestors in their generations.

The Lord created great glory in them—

his mighty power from the beginning.

Some ruled in their kingdoms

and were men renowned for their power,

giving counsel by their understanding.

Some have spoken in prophecies,

leaders of the people by their counsels,

and by their understanding, giving instruction for the people.

Their words in their instruction were wise.

Some composed musical tunes,

and set forth verses in writing,

rich men endowed with ability,

living peaceably in their homes.

All these were honored in their generations,

and were outstanding in their days.

Some of them have left a name behind them,

so that others declare their praises.

But of others, there is no memory.

They perished as though they had not been.

They become as though they had not been born,

they and their children after them.

But these were men of mercy,

whose righteous deeds have not been forgotten.

A good inheritance remains with their offspring.

Their children are within the covenant.

Their offspring stand fast,

with their children, for their sakes.

Their offspring will remain forever.

Their glory won’t be blotted out.

Their bodies were buried in peace.

Their name lives to all generations.

People will declare their wisdom.

The congregation proclaims their praise.

Enoch pleased the Lord, and was taken up,

an example of repentance to all generations.

Noah was found perfect and righteous.

In the season of wrath, he kept the race alive.

Therefore a remnant was left on the earth

when the flood came.

Everlasting covenants were made with him,

that all flesh should no more be blotted out by a flood.

Abraham was a great father of a multitude of nations.

There was none found like him in glory,

who kept the law of the Most High,

and was taken into covenant with him.

In his flesh he established the covenant.

When he was tested, he was found faithful.

Therefore he assured him by an oath

that the nations would be blessed through his offspring,

that he would multiply him like the dust of the earth,

exalt his offspring like the stars,

and cause them to inherit from sea to sea,

and from the Euphrates River to the utmost parts of the earth.

In Isaac also, he established the same assurance for Abraham his father’s sake,

the blessing of all men, and the covenant.

He made it rest upon the head of Jacob.

He acknowledged him in his blessings,

gave to him by inheritance,

and divided his portions.

He distributed them among twelve tribes.

### Chapter 45

He brought out of him a man of mercy,

who found favor in the sight of all people,

a man loved by God and men, even Moses,

whose memory is blessed.

He made him equal to the glory of the saints,

and magnified him in the fears of his enemies.

By his words he caused the wonders to cease.

God glorified him in the sight of kings.

He gave him commandments for his people

and showed him part of his glory.

He sanctified him in his faithfulness and meekness.

He chose him out of all people.

He made him to hear his voice,

led him into the thick darkness,

and gave him commandments face to face,

even the law of life and knowledge,

that he might teach Jacob the covenant,

and Israel his judgments.

He exalted Aaron, a holy man like Moses,

even his brother, of the tribe of Levi.

He established an everlasting covenant with him,

and gave him the priesthood of the people.

He blessed him with stateliness,

and dressed him in a glorious robe.

He clothed him in perfect splendor,

and strengthened him with symbols of authority:

the linen trousers, the long robe, and the ephod.

He encircled him with pomegranates;

with many golden bells around him,

to make a sound as he went,

to make a sound that might be heard in the temple,

for a reminder for the children of his people;

with a holy garment, with gold, blue, and purple, the work of the embroiderer;

with an oracle of judgment—Urim and Thummim;

with twisted scarlet, the work of the craftsman;

with precious stones engraved like a signet, in a setting of gold, the work of the jeweller,

for a reminder engraved in writing, after the number of the tribes of Israel;

with a crown of gold upon the mitre, having engraved on it, as on a signet, “HOLINESS”,

an ornament of honor, the work of an expert,

the desires of the eyes, goodly and beautiful.

Before him there never have been anything like it.

No stranger put them on, but only his sons and his offspring perpetually.

His sacrifices shall be wholly burned,

twice every day continually.

Moses consecrated him,

and anointed him with holy oil.

It was an everlasting covenant with him

and to his offspring, all the days of heaven,

to minister to the Lord, to serve as a priest,

and to bless his people in his name.

He chose him out of all living

to offer sacrifice to the Lord—

incense, and a sweet fragrance, for a memorial,

to make atonement for your people.

He gave to him in his commandments,

authority in the covenants of judgments,

to teach Jacob the testimonies,

and to enlighten Israel in his law.

Strangers conspired against him

and envied him in the wilderness:

Dathan and Abiram with their company,

and the congregation of Korah, with wrath and anger.

The Lord saw it, and it displeased him.

In the wrath of his anger, they were destroyed.

He did wonders upon them,

to consume them with flaming fire.

He added glory to Aaron,

and gave him a heritage.

He divided to him the first fruits of the increase,

and prepared bread of first fruits in abundance.

For they eat the sacrifices of the Lord,

which he gave to him and to his offspring.

However, in the land of the people, he has no inheritance,

and he has no portion among the people,

for the Lord himself is your portion and inheritance.

Phinehas the son of Eleazar is the third in glory,

in that he was zealous in the fear of the Lord,

and stood fast when the people turned away,

and he made atonement for Israel.

Therefore, a covenant of peace was established for him,

that he should be leader of the sanctuary and of his people,

that he and his offspring should have the dignity of the priesthood forever.

Also he made a covenant with David the son of Jesse, of the tribe of Judah.

The inheritance of the king is his alone from son to son.

So the inheritance of Aaron is also to his seed.

May God give you wisdom in your heart

to judge his people in righteousness,

that their good things may not be abolished,

and that their glory may endure for all their generations.

### Chapter 46

Joshua the son of Nun was valiant in war,

and was the successor of Moses in prophecies.

He was made great according to his name

for the saving of God’s elect,

to take vengeance on the enemies that rose up against them,

that he might give Israel their inheritance.

How was he glorified in the lifting up his hands,

and in stretching out his sword against the cities!

Who before him stood so firm?

For the Lord himself brought his enemies to him.

Didn’t the sun go back by his hand?

Didn’t one day become as two?

He called upon the Most High, the Mighty One,

when his foes pressed in all around him,

and the great Lord heard him.

With hailstones of mighty power,

he caused war to break violently upon the nation,

and on the slope he destroyed those who resisted,

so that the nations might know his armor,

how he fought in the sight of the Lord;

for he followed the Mighty One.

Also in the time of Moses, he did a work of mercy—

he and Caleb the son of Jephunneh—

in that they withstood the adversary,

hindered the people from sin,

and stilled their wicked complaining.

And of six hundred thousand people on foot, they two alone were preserved

to bring them into their inheritance,

into a land flowing with milk and honey.

The Lord gave strength to Caleb,

and it remained with him to his old age,

so that he entered the hill country,

and his offspring obtained it for an inheritance,

that all the children of Israel might see that it is good to follow the Lord.

Also the judges, every one by his name,

all whose hearts didn’t engage in immorality,

and who didn’t turn away from the Lord—

may their memory be blessed!

May their bones flourish again out of their place.

May the name of those who have been honored be renewed in their children.

Samuel, the prophet of the Lord, loved by his Lord,

established a kingdom and anointed princes over his people.

By the law of the Lord he judged the congregation,

and the Lord watched over Jacob.

By his faithfulness he was proved to be a prophet.

By his words he was known to be faithful in vision.

When his enemies pressed on him on every side,

he called upon the Lord, the Mighty One,

with the offering of the suckling lamb.

Then the Lord thundered from heaven.

He made his voice heard with a mighty sound.

He utterly destroyed the rulers of the Tyrians

and all the princes of the Philistines.

Before the time of his age-long sleep,

he testified in the sight of the lord and his anointed,

“I have not taken any man’s goods, so much as a sandal;”

and no one accused him.

Even after he fell asleep, he prophesied,

and showed the king his end,

and lifted up his voice from the earth in prophecy,

to blot out the wickedness of the people.

### Chapter 47

After him, Nathan rose up

to prophesy in the days of David.

As is the fat when it is separated from the peace offering,

so was David separated from the children of Israel.

He played with lions as with kids,

and with bears as with lambs of the flock.

In his youth didn’t he kill a giant,

and take away reproach from the people

when he lifted up his hand with a sling stone,

and beat down the boasting Goliath?

For he called upon the Most High Lord,

and he gave him strength in his right hand

to kill a man mighty in war,

to exalt the horn of his people.

So they glorified him for his tens of thousands,

and praised him for the blessings of the Lord,

in that a glorious diadem was given to him.

For he destroyed the enemies on every side,

and defeated the Philistines his adversaries.

He broke their horn in pieces to this day.

In every work of his he gave thanks to the Holy One Most High with words of glory.

He sang praise with his whole heart,

and loved him who made him.

He set singers before the altar,

to make sweet melody by their music.

He gave beauty to the feasts,

and set in order the seasons to completion

while they praised his holy name,

and the sanctuary resounded from early morning.

The Lord took away his sins,

and exalted his horn forever.

He gave him a covenant of kings,

and a glorious throne in Israel.

After him a wise son rose up,

who because of him lived in security.

Solomon reigned in days of peace.

God gave him rest all around,

that he might set up a house for his name,

and prepare a sanctuary forever.

How wise you were made in your youth,

and filled as a river with understanding!

Your influence covered the earth,

and you filled it with parables and riddles.

Your name reached to the far away islands,

and you were loved for your peace.

For your songs, proverbs, parables,

and interpretations, the countries marveled at you.

By the name of the Lord God,

who is called the God of Israel,

you gathered gold like tin,

and multiplied silver like lead.

You bowed your loins to women,

and in your body you were brought into subjection.

You blemished your honor,

and defiled your offspring,

to bring wrath upon your children.

I was grieved for your folly,

because the sovereignty was divided,

and a disobedient kingdom ruled out of Ephraim.

But the Lord will never forsake his mercy.

He won’t destroy any of his works,

nor blot out the posterity of his elect.

He won’t take away the offspring him who loved him.

He gave a remnant to Jacob,

and to David a root from his own family.

So Solomon rested with his fathers.

Of his offspring, he left behind him Rehoboam,

the foolishness of the people, and one who lacked understanding,

who made the people revolt by his counsel.

Also Jeroboam the son of Nebat,

who made Israel to sin,

and gave a way of sin to Ephraim.

Their sins were multiplied exceedingly,

until they were removed from their land.

For they sought out all manner of wickedness,

until vengeance came upon them.

### Chapter 48

Then Elijah arose, the prophet like fire.

His word burned like a torch.

He brought a famine upon them,

and by his zeal made them few in number.

By the word of the Lord he shut up the heavens.

He brought down fire three times.

How you were glorified, O Elijah, in your wondrous deeds!

Whose glory is like yours?

You raised up a dead man from death,

from Hades, by the word of the Most High.

You brought down kings to destruction,

and honorable men from their sickbeds.

You heard rebuke in Sinai,

and judgments of vengeance in Horeb.

You anointed kings for retribution,

and prophets to succeed after you.

You were taken up in a tempest of fire,

in a chariot of fiery horses.

You were recorded for reproofs in their seasons,

to pacify anger, before it broke out into wrath,

to turn the heart of the father to the son,

and to restore the tribes of Jacob.

Blessed are those who saw you,

and those who have been beautified with love;

for we also shall surely live.

Elijah was wrapped in a whirlwind.

Elisha was filled with his spirit.

In his days he was not moved by the fear of any ruler,

and no one brought him into subjection.

Nothing was too hard for him.

When he was buried, his body prophesied.

As in his life he did wonders,

so his works were also marvelous in death.

For all this the people didn’t repent.

They didn’t depart from their sins,

until they were carried away as a plunder from their land,

and were scattered through all the earth.

The people were left very few in number,

but with a ruler from the house of David.

Some of them did that which was right,

but some multiplied sins.

Hezekiah fortified his city,

and brought water into its midst.

He tunneled through rock with iron,

and built cisterns for water.

In his days Sennacherib invaded,

and sent Rabshakeh, and departed.

He lifted up his hand against Zion,

and boasted great things in his arrogance.

Then their hearts and their hands were shaken,

and they were in pain, as women in labor.

But they called upon the Lord who is merciful,

spreading out their hands to him.

The Holy One quickly heard them out of Heaven,

and delivered them by the hand of Isaiah.

He struck the camp of the Assyrians,

and his angel utterly destroyed them.

For Hezekiah did that which was pleasing to the Lord,

and was strong in the ways of his ancestor David,

which Isaiah the prophet commanded,

who was great and faithful in his vision.

In his days the sun went backward.

He prolonged the life of the king.

He saw by an excellent spirit what would come to pass in the future;

and he comforted those who mourned in Zion.

He showed the things that would happen through the end of time,

and the hidden things before they came.

### Chapter 49

The memory of Josiah is like the composition of incense

prepared by the work of the perfumer.

It will be sweet as honey in every mouth,

and like music at a banquet of wine.

He did what was right in the reforming of the people,

and took away the abominations of iniquity.

He set his heart right toward the Lord.

In lawless days, he made godliness prevail.

Except David, Hezekiah, and Josiah,

all were wicked,

because they abandoned the law of the Most High.

The kings of Judah came to an end.

They gave their power to others,

and their glory to a foreign nation.

They set the chosen city of the sanctuary on fire

and made her streets desolate, as it was written by the hand of Jeremiah.

For they mistreated him;

yet he was sanctified in the womb to be a prophet,

to root out, to afflict, to destroy

and likewise to build and to plant.

Ezekiel saw the vision of glory,

which God showed him on the chariot of the cherubim.

For truly he remembered the enemies in rainstorm,

and to do good to those who directed their ways aright.

Also of the twelve prophets,

may their bones flourish again out of their place.

He comforted the people of Jacob,

and delivered them by confident hope.

How shall we magnify Zerubbabel?

He was like a signet ring on the right hand.

So was Jesus the son of Josedek,

who in their days built the house,

and exalted a people holy to the Lord,

prepared for everlasting glory.

Also of Nehemiah the memory is great.

He raised up for us fallen walls,

set up the gates and bars,

and rebuilt our houses.

No man was created upon the earth like Enoch,

for he was taken up from the earth.

Nor was there a man born like Joseph,

a leader of his kindred, a supporter of the people.

Even his bones were cared for.

Shem and Seth were honored among men,

but above every living thing in the creation was Adam.

### Chapter 50

It was Simon, the son of Onias, the high priest,

who in his life repaired the house,

and in his days strengthened the temple.

The foundation was built by him to the height of the double walls,

the lofty retaining walls of the temple enclosure.

In his days, a water cistern was dug,

the brazen vessel like the sea in circumference.

He planned to save his people from ruin,

and fortified the city against siege.

How glorious he was when the people gathered around him

as he came out of the house of the veil!

He was like the morning star among clouds,

like the full moon,

like the sun shining on the temple of the Most High,

like the rainbow shining in clouds of glory,

like roses in the days of first fruits,

like lilies by a water spring,

like the shoot of the frankincense tree in summer time,

like fire and incense in the censer,

like a vessel of beaten gold adorned with all kinds of precious stones,

like an olive tree loaded with fruit,

and like a cypress growing high among the clouds.

When he put on his glorious robe,

and clothed himself in perfect splendor,

ascending to the holy altar,

he made the court of the sanctuary glorious.

When he received the portions out of the priests’ hands,

as he stood by the hearth of the altar,

with his kindred like a garland around him,

he was like a young cedar in Lebanon

surrounded by the trunks of palm trees.

All the sons of Aaron in their glory,

held the Lord’s offering in their hands before all the congregation of Israel.

Finishing the service at the altars,

that he might arrange the offering of the Most High, the Almighty,

he stretched out his hand to the cup of libation,

and poured out the cup of the grape.

He poured it out at the foot of the altar,

a sweet smelling fragrance to the Most High, the King of all.

Then the sons of Aaron shouted.

They sounded the trumpets of beaten work.

They made a great fanfare to be heard,

for a reminder before the Most High.

Then all the people together hurried,

and fell down to the ground on their faces

to worship their Lord, the Almighty, God Most High.

The singers also praised him with their voices.

There was a sweet melody in the whole house.

And the people implored the Lord Most High,

in prayer before him who is merciful,

until the worship of the Lord was finished,

and so they accomplished his service.

Then he went down, and lifted up his hands

over the whole congregation of the children of Israel,

to give blessing to the Lord with his lips,

and to glory in his name.

He bowed himself down in worship the second time,

to declare the blessing from the Most High.

Now bless the God of all,

who everywhere does great things,

who exalts our days from the womb,

and deals with us according to his mercy.

May he grant us joyfulness of heart,

and that peace may be in our days in Israel for the days of eternity,

to entrust his mercy with us,

and let him deliver us in his time!

With two nations my soul is vexed,

and the third is no nation:

Those who sit on the mountain of Samaria, the Philistines,

and the foolish people who live in Shechem.

I have written in this book the instruction of understanding and knowledge,

I Jesus, the son of Sirach Eleazar, of Jerusalem,

who out of his heart poured forth wisdom.

Blessed is he who will exercise these things.

He who lays them up in his heart will become wise.

For if he does them, he will be strong in all things,

for the light of the Lord is his guide.

### Chapter 51

A Prayer of Jesus the son of Sirach.

I will give thanks to you, O Lord, O King,

and will praise you, O God my Savior.

I give thanks to your name,

for you have been my protector and helper,

and delivered my body out of destruction,

and out of the snare of a slanderous tongue,

from lips that fabricate lies.

You were my helper before those who stood by,

and delivered me, according to the abundance of your mercy and of your name,

from the gnashings of teeth ready to devour,

out of the hand of those seeking my life,

out of the many afflictions I endured,

from the choking of a fire on every side,

and out of the midst of fire that I hadn’t kindled,

out of the depth of the belly of Hades,

from an unclean tongue,

and from lying words—

the slander of an unrighteous tongue to the king.

My soul drew near to death.

My life was near to Hades.

They surrounded me on every side.

There was no one to help me.

I was looking for human help,

and there was none.

Then I remembered your mercy, O Lord,

and your working which has been from everlasting,

how you deliver those who wait for you,

and save them out of the hand of their enemies.

I lifted up my prayer from the earth,

and prayed for deliverance from death.

I called upon the Lord, the Father of my Lord,

that he would not forsake me in the days of affliction,

in the time when there was no help against the proud.

I will praise your name continually.

I will sing praise with thanksgiving.

My prayer was heard.

You saved me from destruction

and delivered me from the evil time.

Therefore I will give thanks and praise to you,

and bless the name of the Lord.

When I was yet young,

before I went abroad,

I sought wisdom openly in my prayer.

Before the temple I asked for her.

I will seek her out even to the end.

From the first flower to the ripening grape my heart delighted in her.

My foot walked in uprightness.

From my youth I followed her steps.

I inclined my ear a little, and received her,

and found for myself much instruction.

I profited in her.

I will give glory to him who gives me wisdom.

For I determined to practice her.

I was zealous for that which is good.

I will never be put to shame.

My soul has wrestled with her.

In my conduct I was exact.

I spread out my hands to the heaven above,

and bewailed my ignorances of her.

I directed my soul to her.

In purity I found her.

I got myself a heart joined with her from the beginning.

Therefore I won’t be forsaken.

My belly also was troubled to seek her.

Therefore I have gained a good possession.

The Lord gave me a tongue for my reward.

I will praise him with it.

Draw near to me, all you who are uneducated,

and live in the house of instruction.

Why therefore are you all lacking in these things,

and your souls are very thirsty?

I opened my mouth and spoke,

“Get her for yourselves without money.”

Put your neck under the yoke,

and let your soul receive instruction.

She is near to find.

See with your eyes

how that I labored just a little

and found for myself much rest.

Get instruction with a great sum of silver,

and gain much gold by her.

May your soul rejoice in his mercy,

and may you all not be put to shame in praising him.

Work your work before the time comes,

and in his time he will give you your reward.

## Baruch

The book of Baruch is recognized as Deuterocanonical Scripture by the Roman Catholic, Greek Orthodox, and Russian Orthodox Churches. In some Bibles, Baruch chapter 6 is listed as a separate book called The Letter of Jeremiah, reflecting its separation from Baruch in some copies of the Greek Septuagint.

### Chapter 1

These are the words of the book which Baruch the son of Nerias, the son of Maaseas, the son of Sedekias, the son of Asadias, the son of Helkias, wrote in Babylon, in the fifth year, in the seventh day of the month, at the time when the Chaldeans took Jerusalem and burned it with fire. Baruch read the words of this book in the hearing of Jechonias the son of Joakim king of Judah, and in the hearing of all the people who came to hear the book, and in the hearing of the mighty men, and of the kings’ sons, and in the hearing of the elders, and in the hearing of all the people, from the least to the greatest, even of all those who lived at Babylon by the river Sud. Then they wept, fasted, and prayed before the Lord. They also made a collection of money according to every man’s ability; and they sent it to Jerusalem to Joakim the high priest, the son of Helkias, the son of Salom, and to the priests and to all the people who were found with him at Jerusalem, at the same time when he took the vessels of the house of the Lord, that had been carried out of the temple, to return them into the land of Judah, the tenth day of Sivan—silver vessels which Sedekias the son of Josias king of Judah had made, after Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon had carried away Jechonias, the princes, the captives, the mighty men, and the people of the land from Jerusalem, and brought them to Babylon.

And they said: Behold, we have sent you money; therefore buy with the money burnt offerings, sin offerings, and incense, and prepare an oblation, and offer upon the altar of the Lord our God; and pray for the life of Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon, and for the life of Baltasar his son, that their days may be as the days of heaven above the earth. The Lord will give us strength and light to our eyes. We will live under the shadow of Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon and under the shadow of Baltasar his son, and we shall serve them many days, and find favor in their sight. Pray for us also to the Lord our God, for we have sinned against the Lord our God. To this day the wrath of the Lord and his indignation is not turned from us. You shall read this book which we have sent to you, to make confession in the house of the Lord upon the day of the feast and on the days of the solemn assembly.

You shall say: To the Lord our God belongs righteousness, but to us confusion of face, as at this day—to the men of Judah, to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, to our kings, to our princes, to our priests, to our prophets, and to our fathers, because we have sinned before the Lord. We have disobeyed him and have not listened to the voice of the Lord our God, to walk in the commandments of the Lord that he has set before us. Since the day that the Lord brought our fathers out of the land of Egypt to this present day, we have been disobedient to the Lord our God, and we have been negligent in not listening to his voice. Therefore the plagues have clung to us, along with the curse which the Lord declared through Moses his servant in the day that he brought our fathers out of the land of Egypt to give us a land that flows with milk and honey, as at this day. Nevertheless we didn’t listen to the voice of the Lord our God, according to all the words of the prophets whom he sent to us, but we each walked in the imagination of his own wicked heart, to serve strange gods and to do what is evil in the sight of the Lord our God.

### Chapter 2

Therefore the Lord has made good his word which he pronounced against us, and against our judges who judged Israel, and against our kings, and against our princes, and against the men of Israel and Judah, to bring upon us great plagues such as never happened before under the whole heaven, as it came to pass in Jerusalem, according to the things that are written in the law of Moses, that we should each eat the flesh of our own son, and each eat the flesh of our own daughter. Moreover he has given them to be in subjection to all the kingdoms that are around us, to be a reproach and a desolation among all the people around us, where the Lord has scattered them. Thus they were cast down and not exalted, because we sinned against the Lord our God in not listening to his voice. To the Lord our God belongs righteousness, but to us and to our fathers confusion of face, as at this day. All these plagues have come upon us which the Lord has pronounced against us. Yet have we not entreated the favor of the Lord by everyone turning from the thoughts of his wicked heart. Therefore the Lord has kept watch over the plagues. The Lord has brought them upon us, for the Lord is righteous in all his works which he has commanded us. Yet we have not listened to his voice, to walk in the commandments of the Lord that he has set before us.

And now, O Lord, you God of Israel who have brought your people out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand, with signs, with wonders, with great power, and with a high arm, and have gotten yourself a name, as at this day: O Lord our God, we have sinned. We have been ungodly. We have done wrong in all your ordinances. Let your wrath turn from us, for we are but a few left among the heathen where you have scattered us. Hear our prayer, O Lord, and our petition, and deliver us for your own sake. Give us favor in the sight of those who have led us away captive, that all the earth may know that you are the Lord our God, because Israel and his posterity is called by your name. O Lord, look down from your holy house and consider us. Incline your ear, O Lord, and hear. Open your eyes, and see; for the dead that are in Hades, whose breath is taken from their bodies, will give to the Lord neither glory nor righteousness; but the soul who is greatly vexed, who goes stooping and feeble, and the eyes that fail, and the hungry soul, will declare your glory and righteousness, O Lord.

For we do not present our supplication before you, O Lord our God, for the righteousness of our fathers and of our kings. For you have sent your wrath and your indignation upon us, as you have spoken by your servants the prophets, saying, “The Lord says, ‘Bow your shoulders to serve the king of Babylon, and remain in the land that I gave to your fathers. But if you won’t hear the voice of the Lord to serve the king of Babylon, I will cause to cease out of the cities of Judah and from the region near Jerusalem the voice of mirth, the voice of gladness, voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride. The whole land will be desolate without inhabitant.’” But we wouldn’t listen to your voice, to serve the king of Babylon. Therefore you have made good your words that you spoke by your servants the prophets, that the bones of our kings and the bones of our fathers would be taken out of their places. Behold, they are cast out to the heat by day and to the frost by night. They died in great miseries by famine, by sword, and by pestilence. You have made the house that is called by your name as it is today because of the wickedness of the house of Israel and the house of Judah.

Yet, O Lord our God, you have dealt with us after all your kindness and according to all your great mercy, as you spoke by your servant Moses in the day when you commanded him to write your law in the presence of the children of Israel, saying, “If you won’t hear my voice, surely this very great multitude will be turned into a small number among the nations where I will scatter them. For I know that they will not hear me, because they are a stiff-necked people; but in the land of their captivity they will take it to heart, and will know that I am the Lord their God. I will give them a heart and ears to hear. Then they will praise me in the land of their captivity, and think about my name, and will return from their stiff neck and from their wicked deeds; for they will remember the way of their fathers who sinned before the Lord. I will bring them again into the land which I promised to their fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, and they will rule over it. I will increase them, and they won’t be diminished. And I will make an everlasting covenant with them to be their God, and they will be my people. I will no more remove my people Israel out of the land that I have given them.”

### Chapter 3

O Lord Almighty, you God of Israel, the soul in anguish and the troubled spirit cries to you. Hear, O Lord, and have mercy; for you are a merciful God. Yes, have mercy upon us, because we have sinned before you. For you are enthroned forever, and we keep perishing. O Lord Almighty, you God of Israel, hear now the prayer of the dead Israelites, and of the children of those who were sinners before you, who didn’t listen to the voice of you their God; because of this, these plagues cling to us. Don’t remember the iniquities of our fathers, but remember your power and your name at this time. For you are the Lord our God, and we will praise you, O Lord. For this cause, you have put your fear in our hearts, to the intent that we should call upon your name. We will praise you in our captivity, for we have called to mind all the iniquity of our fathers who sinned before you. Behold, we are yet this day in our captivity where you have scattered us, for a reproach and a curse, and to be subject to penalty according to all the iniquities of our fathers who departed from the Lord our God.

Hear, O Israel, the commandments of life! Give ear to understand wisdom! How is it, O Israel, that you are in your enemies’ land, that you have become old in a strange country, that you are defiled with the dead, that you are counted with those who are in Hades? You have forsaken the fountain of wisdom. If you had walked in the way of God, you would have dwelled in peace forever. Learn where there is wisdom, where there is strength, and where there is understanding, that you may also know where there is length of days and life, where there is the light of the eyes and peace. Who has found out her place? Who has come into her treasuries? Where are the princes of the heathen, and those who ruled the beasts that are on the earth, those who had their pastime with the fowls of the air, and those who hoarded up silver and gold, in which people trust, and of their getting there is no end? For those who diligently sought silver, and were so anxious, and whose works are past finding out, they have vanished and gone down to Hades, and others have come up in their place.

Younger men have seen the light and lived upon the earth, but they haven’t known the way of knowledge, nor understood its paths. Their children haven’t embraced it. They are far off from their way. It has not been heard of in Canaan, neither has it been seen in Teman. The sons also of Agar who seek understanding, which are in the land, the merchants of Merran and Teman, and the authors of fables, and the searchers out of understanding—none of these have known the way of wisdom or remembered her paths.

O Israel, how great is the house of God! How large is the place of his possession! It is great and has no end. It is high and unmeasurable. Giants were born that were famous of old, great of stature, and expert in war. God didn’t choose these, nor did he give the way of knowledge to them, so they perished, because they had no wisdom. They perished through their own foolishness. Who has gone up into heaven, taken her, and brought her down from the clouds? Who has gone over the sea, found her, and will bring her for choice gold? There is no one who knows her way, nor any who comprehend her path. But he that knows all things knows her, he found her out with his understanding. He who prepared the earth for all time has filled it with four-footed beasts. It is he who sends forth the light, and it goes. He called it, and it obeyed him with fear. The stars shone in their watches, and were glad. When he called them, they said, “Here we are.” They shone with gladness to him who made them. This is our God. No other can be compared to him. He has found out all the way of knowledge, and has given it to Jacob his servant and to Israel who is loved by him. Afterward she appeared upon earth, and lived with men.

### Chapter 4

This is the book of God’s commandments and the law that endures forever. All those who hold it fast will live, but those who leave it will die. Turn, O Jacob, and take hold of it. Walk toward the shining of its light. Don’t give your glory to another, nor the things that are to your advantage to a foreign nation. O Israel, we are happy; for the things that are pleasing to God are made known to us.

Be of good cheer, my people, the memorial of Israel. You were not sold to the nations for destruction, but because you moved God to wrath, you were delivered to your adversaries. For you provoked him who made you by sacrificing to demons and not to God. You forgot the everlasting God who brought you up. You also grieved Jerusalem, who nursed you. For she saw the wrath that came upon you from God, and said, “Listen, you who dwell near Zion; for God has brought upon me great mourning. For I have seen the captivity of my sons and daughters, which the Everlasting has brought upon them. For with joy I nourished them, but sent them away with weeping and mourning. Let no man rejoice over me, a widow and forsaken by many. For the sins of my children, I am left desolate, because they turned away from the law of God and had no regard for his statutes. They didn’t walk in the ways of God’s commandments or tread in the paths of discipline in his righteousness. Let those who dwell near Zion come and remember the captivity of my sons and daughters, which the Everlasting has brought upon them. For he has brought a nation upon them from afar, a shameless nation with a strange language, who didn’t respect old men or pity children. They have carried away the dear beloved sons of the widow, and left her who was alone desolate of her daughters.”

But I—how can I help you? For he who brought these calamities upon you will deliver you from the hand of your enemies. Go your way, O my children. Go your way, for I am left desolate. I have put off the garment of peace, and put on the sackcloth of my petition. I will cry to the Everlasting as long as I live.

Take courage, my children. Cry to God, and he will deliver you from the power and hand of the enemies. For I have trusted in the Everlasting, that he will save you; and joy has come to me from the Holy One, because of the mercy that will soon come to you from your Everlasting Savior. For I sent you out with mourning and weeping, but God will give you to me again with joy and gladness forever. For as now those who dwell near Zion have seen your captivity, so they will shortly see your salvation from our God which will come upon you with great glory and brightness of the Everlasting. My children, suffer patiently the wrath that has come upon you from God, for your enemy has persecuted you; but shortly you will see his destruction and will tread upon their necks. My delicate ones have traveled rough roads. They were taken away like a flock carried off by enemies.

Take courage, my children, and cry to God; for you will be remembered by him who has brought this upon you. For as it was your decision to go astray from God, return and seek him ten times more. For he who brought these calamities upon you will bring you everlasting joy again with your salvation. Take courage, O Jerusalem, for he who called you by name will comfort you. Miserable are those who afflicted you and rejoiced at your fall. Miserable are the cities which your children served. Miserable is she who received your sons. For as she rejoiced at your fall and was glad of your ruin, so she will be grieved at her own desolation. And I will take away her pride in her great multitude and her boasting will be turned into mourning. For fire will come upon her from the Everlasting for many days; and she will be inhabited by demons for a long time.

O Jerusalem, look around you toward the east, and behold the joy that comes to you from God. Behold, your sons come, whom you sent away. They come gathered together from the east to the west at the word of the Holy One, rejoicing in the glory of God.

### Chapter 5

Take off the garment of your mourning and affliction, O Jerusalem, and put on forever the beauty of the glory from God. Put on the robe of the righteousness from God. Set on your head a diadem of the glory of the Everlasting. For God will show your splendor everywhere under heaven. For your name will be called by God forever “Righteous Peace, Godly Glory”.

Arise, O Jerusalem, and stand upon the height. Look around you toward the east and see your children gathered from the going down of the sun to its rising at the word of the Holy One, rejoicing that God has remembered them. For they went from you on foot, being led away by their enemies, but God brings them in to you carried on high with glory, on a royal throne. For God has appointed that every high mountain and the everlasting hills should be made low, and the valleys filled up to make the ground level, that Israel may go safely in the glory of God. Moreover the woods and every sweet smelling tree have shaded Israel by the commandment of God. For God will lead Israel with joy in the light of his glory with the mercy and righteousness that come from him.

### Chapter 6

The Letter of Jeremy (Jeremiah)

A copy of a letter that Jeremy sent to those who were to be led captives into Babylon by the king of the Babylonians, to give them the message that God commanded him.

Because of the sins which you have committed before God, you will be led away captives to Babylon by Nabuchodonosor king of the Babylonians. So when you come to Babylon, you will remain there many years, and for a long season, even for seven generations. After that, I will bring you out peacefully from there. But now you will see in Babylon gods of silver, gold, wood carried on shoulders, which cause the nations to fear. Beware therefore that you in no way become like these foreigners. Don’t let fear take hold of you because of them when you see the multitude before them and behind them, worshiping them. But say in your hearts, “O Lord, we must worship you.” For my angel is with you, and I myself care for your souls. For their tongue is polished by the workman, and they themselves are overlaid with gold and with silver; yet they are only fake, and can’t speak. And taking gold, as if it were for a virgin who loves to be happy, they make crowns for the heads of their gods. Sometimes also the priests take gold and silver from their gods, and spend it on themselves. They will even give some of it to the common prostitutes. They dress them like men with garments, even the gods of silver, gods of gold, and gods of wood. Yet these gods can’t save themselves from rust and moths, even though they are covered with purple garments. They wipe their faces because of the dust of the temple, which is thick upon them. And he who can’t put to death one who offends against him holds a sceptre, as though he were judge of a country. He has also a dagger in his right hand, and an axe, but can’t deliver himself from war and robbers. By this they are known not to be gods. Therefore don’t fear them. For like a vessel that a man uses is worth nothing when it is broken, even so it is with their gods. When they are set up in the temples, their eyes are full of dust through the feet of those who come in. As the courts are secured on every side upon him who offends the king, as being committed to suffer death, even so the priests secure their temples with doors, with locks, and bars, lest they be carried off by robbers. They light candles for them, yes, more than for themselves, even though they can’t see one. They are like one of the beams of the temple. Men say their hearts are eaten out when things creeping out of the earth devour both them and their clothing. They don’t feel it when their faces are blackened through the smoke that comes out of the temple. Bats, swallows, and birds land on their bodies and heads. So do the cats. By this you may know that they are no gods. Therefore don’t fear them. Notwithstanding the gold with which they are covered to make them beautiful, unless someone wipes off the tarnish, they won’t shine; for they didn’t even feel it when they were molten. Things in which there is no breath are bought at any cost. Having no feet, they are carried upon shoulders. By this, they declare to men that they are worth nothing. Those who serve them are also ashamed, for if they fall to the ground at any time, they can’t rise up again by themselves. If they are bowed down, they can’t make themselves straight; but the offerings are set before them, as if they were dead men. And the things that are sacrificed to them, their priests sell and spend. In like manner, their wives also lay up part of it in salt; but to the poor and to the impotent they give none of it. The menstruous woman and the woman in childbed touch their sacrifices, knowing therefore by these things that they are no gods. Don’t fear them. For how can they be called gods? Because women set food before the gods of silver, gold, and wood. And in their temples the priests sit on seats, having their clothes torn and their heads and beards shaven, and nothing on their heads. They roar and cry before their gods, as men do at the feast when one is dead. The priests also take off garments from them and clothe their wives and children with them. Whether it is evil or good what one does to them, they are not able to repay it. They can’t set up a king or put him down. In like manner, they can neither give riches nor money. Though a man make a vow to them and doesn’t keep it, they will never exact it. They can save no man from death. They can’t deliver the weak from the mighty. They can’t restore a blind man to his sight, or deliver anyone who is in distress. They can show no mercy to the widow, or do good to the fatherless. They are like the stones that are cut out of the mountain, these gods of wood that are overlaid with gold and with silver. Those who minister to them will be confounded.

How could a man then think or say that they are gods, when even the Chaldeans themselves dishonor them? If they shall see one mute who can’t speak, they bring him and ask him to call upon Bel, as though he were able to understand. Yet they can’t perceive this themselves, and forsake them; for they have no understanding. The women also with cords around them sit in the ways, burning bran for incense; but if any of them, drawn by someone who passes by, lies with him, she reproaches her fellow, that she was not thought as worthy as herself and her cord wasn’t broken. Whatever is done among them is false. How could a man then think or say that they are gods? They are fashioned by carpenters and goldsmiths. They can be nothing else than what the workmen make them to be. And they themselves who fashioned them can never continue long. How then should the things that are fashioned by them? For they have left lies and reproaches to those who come after. For when there comes any war or plague upon them, the priests consult with themselves, where they may be hidden with them. How then can’t men understand that they are no gods, which can’t save themselves from war or from plague? For seeing they are only wood and overlaid with gold and silver, it will be known hereafter that they are false. It will be manifest to all nations and kings that they are no gods, but the works of men’s hands, and that there is no work of God in them. Who then may not know that they are not gods?

For they can’t set up a king in a land or give rain to men. They can’t judge their own cause, or redress a wrong, being unable; for they are like crows between heaven and earth. For even when fire falls upon the house of gods of wood overlaid with gold or with silver, their priests will flee away, and escape, but they themselves will be burned apart like beams. Moreover they can’t withstand any king or enemies. How could a man then admit or think that they are gods? Those gods of wood overlaid with silver or with gold aren’t able to escape from thieves or robbers. The gold, silver, and garments with which they are clothed—those who are strong will take from them, and go away with them. They won’t be able to help themselves. Therefore it is better to be a king who shows his manhood, or else a vessel in a house profitable for whatever the owner needs, than such false gods—or even a door in a house, to keep the things safe that are in it, than such false gods; or better to be a pillar of wood in a palace than such false gods.

For sun, moon, and stars, being bright and sent to do their jobs, are obedient. Likewise also the lightning when it flashes is beautiful to see. In the same way, the wind also blows in every country. And when God commands the clouds to go over the whole world, they do as they are told. And the fire sent from above to consume mountains and woods does as it is commanded; but these are to be compared to them neither in show nor power. Therefore a man shouldn’t think or say that they are gods, seeing they aren’t able to judge causes or to do good to men. Knowing therefore that they are no gods, don’t fear them. For they can neither curse nor bless kings. They can’t show signs in the heavens among the nations, or shine as the sun, or give light as the moon. The beasts are better than they; for they can get under a covert, and help themselves. In no way then is it manifest to us that they are gods. Therefore don’t fear them. For as a scarecrow in a garden of cucumbers that keeps nothing, so are their gods of wood overlaid with gold and silver. Likewise also their gods of wood overlaid with gold and with silver, are like a white thorn in an orchard that every bird sits upon. They are also like a dead body that is thrown out into the dark. You will know them to be no gods by the bright purple that rots upon them. They themselves will be consumed afterwards, and will be a reproach in the country. Better therefore is the just man who has no idols; for he will be far from reproach.

## 1 Maccabees

The First Book of the Maccabees is recognized as Deuterocanonical Scripture by the Roman Catholic, Greek Orthodox, and Russian Orthodox Churches.

### Chapter 1

After Alexander the Macedonian, the son of Philip, who came out of the land of Chittim, and struck Darius king of the Persians and Medes, it came to pass, after he had struck him, that he reigned in his place, in former time, over Greece. He fought many battles, won many strongholds, killed the kings of the earth, went through to the ends of the earth, and took spoils of a multitude of nations. The earth was quiet before him. He was exalted. His heart was lifted up. He gathered together an exceedingly strong army and ruled over countries, nations, and principalities, and they paid him tribute.

After these things he fell sick, and perceived that he was going to die. He called his honorable servants, which had been brought up with him from his youth, and he divided to them his kingdom while he was still alive. Alexander reigned twelve years, then he died. Then his servants ruled, each one in his place. They all put crowns upon themselves after he was dead, and so did their sons after them many years; and they multiplied evils in the earth.

There came out of them a sinful root, Antiochus Epiphanes, son of Antiochus the king, who had been a hostage at Rome, and he reigned in the one hundred thirty seventh year of the kingdom of the Greeks.

In those days transgressors of the law came out of Israel and persuaded many, saying, “Let’s go make a covenant with the Gentiles around us; for since we were separated from them many evils have befallen us.” That proposal was good in their eyes. Some of the people eagerly went to the king, and he authorized them to observe the ordinances of the Gentiles. So they built a gymnasium in Jerusalem according to the laws of the Gentiles. They made themselves uncircumcised, forsook the holy covenant, joined themselves to the Gentiles, and sold themselves to do evil.

The kingdom was established in the sight of Antiochus, and he planned to reign over Egypt, that he might reign over both kingdoms. He entered into Egypt with a great multitude, with chariots, with elephants, with cavalry, and with a great navy. He made war against Ptolemy king of Egypt. Ptolemy was put to shame before him, and fled; and many fell wounded to death. They took possession of the strong cities in the land of Egypt, and he took the spoils of Egypt.

Antiochus, after he had defeated Egypt, returned in the one hundred forty third year, and went up against Israel and Jerusalem with a great multitude, and entered presumptuously into the sanctuary, and took the golden altar, the lampstand for the light, and all its utensils. He took the table of the show bread, the cups for the drink offerings, the bowls, the golden censers, the veil, the crowns, and the gold decoration on the front of the temple. He peeled it all off. He took the silver, the gold, and the precious vessels. He took the hidden treasures which he found. When he had taken all of these, he went away into his own land. He made a great slaughter, and spoke very arrogantly. Great mourning came upon Israel, in every place where they were. The rulers and elders groaned. The virgins and young men were made feeble. The beauty of the women was changed. Every bridegroom took up lamentation. She who sat in the marriage chamber was mourning. The land was moved for its inhabitants, and all the house of Jacob was clothed with shame.

After two full years, the king sent a chief collector of tribute to the cities of Judah, and he came to Jerusalem with a great multitude. He spoke words of peace to them in subtlety, and they believed him. Then he fell upon the city suddenly, struck it very severely, and destroyed many people of Israel. He took the spoils of the city, set it on fire, and pulled down its houses and its walls on every side. They led captive the women and the children, and seized the livestock. Then they fortified the city of David with a large, strong wall and with strong towers, and it became their citadel. They put a sinful nation, transgressors of the law, there, and they strengthened themselves in it. They stored up weapons and food, and gathering together the spoils of Jerusalem, they stored them there, and they became a great menace. It became a place to lie in wait against the sanctuary, and an evil adversary to Israel continually. They shed innocent blood on every side of the sanctuary, and defiled the sanctuary. The inhabitants of Jerusalem fled because of them. She became a habitation of foreigners. She became foreign to those who were born in her, and her children forsook her. Her sanctuary was laid waste like a wilderness, her feasts were turned into mourning, her Sabbaths into reproach, and her honor into contempt. According to her glory, so was her dishonor multiplied, and her exaltation was turned into mourning.

King Antiochus wrote to his whole kingdom that all should be one people, and that each should forsake his own laws. All the nations agreed according to the word of the king. Many of Israel consented to his worship, sacrificed to the idols, and profaned the Sabbath. The king sent letters by the hand of messengers to Jerusalem and the cities of Judah, that they should follow laws strange to the land, and should forbid whole burnt offerings and sacrifice and drink offerings in the sanctuary; and should profane the Sabbaths and feasts, and pollute the sanctuary and those who were holy; that they should build altars, and temples, and shrines for idols, and should sacrifice swine’s flesh and unclean animals; and that they should leave their sons uncircumcised, that they should make their souls abominable with all manner of uncleanness and profanation; so that they might forget the law, and change all the ordinances. Whoever doesn’t do according to the word of the king, he shall die. According to all these words wrote he to his whole kingdom. He appointed overseers over all the people, and he commanded the cities of Judah to sacrifice, city by city. From the people were gathered together to them many, everyone who had forsaken the law; and they did evil things in the land. They made Israel to hide themselves in every place of refuge which they had.

On the fifteenth day of Chislev, in the one hundred forty fifth year, they built an abomination of desolation upon the altar, and in the cities of Judah on every side they built idol altars. At the doors of the houses and in the streets they burned incense. They tore the books of the law which they found in pieces and set them on fire. Anyone who was found with any a book of the covenant, and if any consented to the law, the king’s sentence delivered him to death. Thus did they in their might to Israel, to those who were found month by month in the cities. On the twenty-fifth day of the month they sacrificed upon the idol altar that was on top of the altar of burnt offering. They put to death women who had circumcised their children, according to the commandment. They hung their babies around their necks, and their houses, and those who had circumcised them. Many in Israel were fully resolved and confirmed in themselves not to eat unclean things. They chose to die, that they might not be defiled with the food, and that they might not profane the holy covenant; and they died. Exceedingly great wrath came upon Israel.

### Chapter 2

In those days Mattathias the son of John, the son of Simeon, a priest of the sons of Joarib, from Jerusalem rose up; and he lived at Modin. And he had five sons: John, who was surnamed Gaddis; Simon, who was called Thassi; Judas, who was called Maccabaeus; Eleazar, who was called Avaran; and Jonathan, who was called Apphus.

He saw the blasphemies that were committed in Judah and in Jerusalem, and he said, “Woe is me! Why was I born to see the destruction of my people and the destruction of the holy city, and to dwell there when it was given into the hand of the enemy, the sanctuary into the hand of foreigners? Her temple has become like a man who was glorious. Her vessels of glory are carried away into captivity. Her infants are slain in her streets. Her young men are slain with the enemy’s sword. What nation has not inherited her palaces and taken possession of her spoils? Her adornment has all been taken away. Instead of a free woman, she has become a slave. Behold, our holy things, our beauty, and our glory are laid waste. The Gentiles have profaned them. Why should we live any longer?”

Mattathias and his sons tore their clothes, put on sackcloth, and mourned exceedingly.

And the king’s officers who were enforcing the apostasy came into the city Modin to sacrifice. Many of Israel came to them, and Mattathias and his sons were gathered together. The king’s officers answered and spoke to Mattathias, saying, “You are a ruler and an honorable and great man in this city, and strengthened with sons and kindred. Now therefore come first and do the commandment of the king, as all the nations have done, including the men of Judah and those who remain in Jerusalem. You and your house will be numbered among the king’s friends, and you and your sons will be honored with silver and gold and many gifts.”

And Mattathias answered and said with a loud voice, “If all the nations that are in the house of the king’s dominion listen to him, to fall away each one from the worship of his fathers, and have made choice to follow his commandments, yet I and my sons and my kindred will walk in the covenant of our fathers. Far be it from us that we should forsake the law and the ordinances. We will not listen to the king’s words, to turn aside from our worship, to the right hand, or to the left.”

When he had finished speaking these words, a Jew came in the sight of all to sacrifice on the altar which was at Modin, according to the king’s commandment. Mattathias saw it, so his zeal was kindled, and his guts trembled, and he vented his wrath according to judgment, and ran and killed him upon the altar. He killed the king’s officer, who compelled men to sacrifice, at the same time, and pulled down the altar. He was zealous for the law, even as Phinehas did to Zimri the son of Salu.

Mattathias cried out in the city with a loud voice, saying, “Whoever is zealous for the law and maintains the covenant, let him follow me!” He and his sons fled into the mountains, and left all that they had in the city.

Then many who sought justice and judgment went down into the wilderness to live there— they, their children, their wives, and their livestock—because evils were multiplied upon them. It was told the king’s officers and the forces that were in Jerusalem, the city of David, that certain men who had broken the king’s commandment had gone down into the secret places in the wilderness; and many pursued after them, and having overtaken them, they encamped against them and set the battle in array against them on the Sabbath day. They said to them, “Enough of this! Come out and do according to the word of the king, and you will all live!”

They said, “We won’t come out. We won’t do the word of the king, to profane the Sabbath day.”

Then the enemy hurried to attack them.

They didn’t answer them. They didn’t cast a stone at them, or block their secret places, saying, “Let’s all die in our innocence. Heaven and earth testify for us, that you put us to death unjustly.”

So they attacked them on the Sabbath, and they died—they, their wives, their children, and their livestock—in number a thousand souls of men.

When Mattathias and his friends found out about it, and they mourned over them exceedingly. One said to another, “If we all do as our kindred have done, and don’t fight against the Gentiles for our lives and our ordinances, they will quickly destroy us from off the earth.” So they decided that day, saying, “Whoever comes against us to battle on the Sabbath day, let’s fight against him, and we will in no way all die, as our kindred died in the secret places.”

Then a company of the Hasidaeans, mighty men of Israel, everyone who offered himself willingly for the law, were gathered together to them. All those who fled from the evils were added to them, and supported them. They mustered an army, and struck sinners in their anger, and lawless men in their wrath. The rest fled to the Gentiles for safety. And Mattathias and his friends went around and pulled down the altars. They forcibly circumcised the boys who were uncircumcised, as many as they found in the coasts of Israel. They pursued the arrogant, and the work prospered in their hand. They rescued the law out of the hand of the Gentiles and out of the hand of the kings. They never allowed the sinner to triumph.

The days of Mattathias drew near that he should die, and he said to his sons, “Now pride and scorn have gained strength. It is a season of overthrow and indignant wrath. Now, my children, be zealous for the law, and give your lives for the covenant of your fathers. Call to remembrance the deeds of our fathers which they did in their generations; and receive great glory and an everlasting name. Wasn’t Abraham found faithful in temptation, and it was reckoned to him for righteousness? Joseph in the time of his distress kept the commandment, and became lord of Egypt. Phinehas our father, because he was exceedingly zealous, obtained the covenant of an everlasting priesthood. Joshua became a judge in Israel for fulfilling the word. Caleb obtained a heritage in the land for testifying in the congregation. David inherited the throne of a kingdom forever and ever for being merciful. Elijah was taken up into heaven because he was exceedingly zealous for the law. Hananiah, Azariah, and Mishael believed, and were saved out of the flame. Daniel was delivered from the mouth of lions for his innocence.

“Thus consider from generation to generation that no one who put their trust in him will lack for strength. Don’t be afraid of the words of a sinful man; for his glory will be dung and worms. Today he will be lifted up, and tomorrow he will in no way be found, because he has returned to dust, and his thought has perished. You, my children, be strong, and show yourselves men on behalf of the law; for in it you will obtain glory. Behold, Simon your brother, whom I know to be a man of counsel. Always listen to him. He shall be a father to you. Judas Maccabaeus has been strong and mighty from his youth. He shall be your captain and shall fight the battle of the people. Rally around all the doers of the law, and avenge the wrong done to your people. Repay the Gentiles, and obey the commandments of the law.”

He blessed them, and was gathered to his ancestors. He died in the one hundred forty sixth year, and his sons buried him in the tombs of his ancestors at Modin. All Israel made great lamentation for him.

### Chapter 3

His son Judas, who was called Maccabaeus, rose up in his place. All his kindred helped him, and so did all those who joined with his father, and they fought with gladness the battle of Israel. He got his people great glory, and put on a breastplate like a giant, and bound his warlike harness around him, and set battles in array, protecting the army with his sword. He was like a lion in his deeds, and like a lion’s cub roaring for prey. He hunted and pursued the lawless, and he burned up those who troubled his people. The lawless shrunk back for fear of him, and all the workers of lawlessness were very troubled, and deliverance prospered in his hand. He angered many kings and made Jacob glad with his acts. His memory is blessed forever. He went through the cities of Judah, destroyed the ungodly out of the land, and turned away wrath from Israel. He was renowned to the utmost part of the earth. He gathered together those who were ready to perish.

Apollonius gathered the Gentiles together with a great army from Samaria to fight against Israel. Judas learned of it, and he went out to meet him, struck him, and killed him. Many fell wounded to death, and the rest fled. They took their spoils, and Judas took Apollonius’ sword, and he fought with it all his days.

Seron, the commander of the army of Syria, heard that Judas had gathered a large company, including a body of faithful men who stayed with him, went out to war. He said, “I will make myself a name and get myself glory in the kingdom. I will fight against Judas and those who are with him, who despise the king’s command. A mighty army of the ungodly went up with him to help him, to take vengeance on the children of Israel.

He came near to the ascent of Bethhoron, and Judas went out to meet him with a small company. But when they saw the army coming to meet them, they said to Judas, “What? Shall we be able, being a small company, to fight against so great and strong a multitude? We for our part are faint, having tasted no food this day.”

Judas said, “It is an easy thing for many to be hemmed in by the hands of a few. With heaven it is all one, to save by many or by few; for victory in battle stands not in the multitude of an army, but strength is from heaven. They come to us in fullness of insolence and lawlessness, to destroy us and our wives and our children, and to plunder us, but we fight for our lives and our laws. He himself will crush them before our face; but as for you, don’t be afraid of them.

Now when he had finished speaking, he rushed suddenly against Seron and his army, and they were defeated before him. They pursued them down the descent of Bethhoron to the plain, and about eight hundred men of them fell; but the rest fled into the land of the Philistines.

The fear of Judas and his kindred, and the dread of them, began to fall on the nations around them. His fame reached the king, and every nation told of the battles of Judas.

But when King Antiochus heard these words, he was full of indignation; and he sent and gathered together all the forces of his realm, an exceedingly strong army. He opened his treasury and gave his forces pay for a year, and commanded them to be ready for every need. He saw that the money was gone from his treasures, and that the tributes of the country were small, because of the dissension and disaster which he had brought upon the land, to the end that he might take away the laws which had been from the first days. He was afraid that he wouldn’t have enough as at other times for the charges and the gifts which he used to give with a liberal hand, more abundantly than the kings who were before him. And he was exceedingly perplexed in his mind, and he determined to go into Persia, and to take the tributes of those countries, and to gather much money. He left Lysias, an honorable man, and one of royal lineage, to be over the affairs of the king from the river Euphrates to the borders of Egypt, and to bring up his son Antiochus, until he came again. He delivered to Lysias half of his forces and the elephants, and gave him charge of all the things that he would have done, and concerning those who lived in Judea and in Jerusalem, that he should send an army against them to root out and destroy the strength of Israel and the remnant of Jerusalem, and to take away their memory from the place, and that he should make foreigners live in all their territory, and should divide their land to them by lot. The king took the half that remained of the forces, and left Antioch, his royal city, in the one hundred forty seventh year; and he passed over the river Euphrates, and went through the upper countries.

Lysias chose Ptolemy the son of Dorymenes, Nicanor, and Gorgias, mighty men of the king’s friends; and with them, he sent forty thousand infantry and seven thousand cavalry to go into the land of Judah and to destroy it, according to the word of the king. They set out with all their army, and came and encamped near Emmaus in the plain country. The merchants of the country heard of their fame, and took silver and gold in large quantities, and fetters, and came into the camp to take the children of Israel for slaves. Forces of Syria and of the land of the Philistines joined with them.

Judas and his kindred saw that evils were multiplied, and that the forces were encamping in their borders. They learned about the king’s words which he had commanded, to destroy the people and make an end of them. Then they each said to his neighbor, “Let’s repair the ruins of our people. Let’s fight for our people and the holy place.” The congregation was gathered together, that they might be ready for battle, and that they might pray and ask for mercy and compassion. Jerusalem was without inhabitant like a wilderness. There was none of her offspring who went in or went out. The sanctuary was trampled down. Children of foreigners were in the citadel. The Gentiles lived there. Joy was taken away from Jacob, and the pipe and the harp ceased. They gathered themselves together, and came to Mizpeh, near Jerusalem; for in Mizpeh there used to be a place of prayer for Israel. They fasted that day, put on sackcloth, put ashes on their heads, tore their clothes, and opened the book of the law, to learn about the things for which the Gentiles consulted the images of their idols. They brought the priests’ garments, the first fruits, and the tithes. They stirred up the Nazarites, who had accomplished their days. They cried aloud toward heaven, saying, “What should we do with these men? Where should we carry them away? Your holy place is trampled down and profaned. Your priests mourn in humiliation. Behold, the Gentiles are assembled together against us to destroy us. You know what things they imagine against us. How will we be able to stand against them, unless you help us?” They sounded with the trumpets, and gave a loud shout.

And after this Judas appointed leaders of the people: captains of thousands, captains of hundreds, captains of fifties, and captains of tens. He said to those who were building houses, were betrothing wives, were planting vineyards, and were fearful, that they should return, each man to his own house, according to the law. The army marched out and encamped upon the south side of Emmaus. Judas said, “Arm yourselves and be valiant men! Be ready in the morning to fight with these Gentiles who are assembled together against us to destroy us and our holy place. For it is better for us to die in battle than to see the calamities of our nation and the holy place. Nevertheless, as may be the will in heaven, so shall he do.

### Chapter 4

Gorgias took five thousand infantry, a thousand chosen cavalry, and the army moved out at night, that it might fall upon the army of the Jews and strike them suddenly. The men of the citadel were his guides. Judas heard of this, and he and the valiant men moved, that he might strike the king’s army which was at Emmaus while the forces were still dispersed from the camp. Gorgias came into the camp of Judas at night and found no man. He sought them in the mountains; for he said, “These men are running away from us.”

As soon as it was day, Judas appeared in the plain with three thousand men. However they didn’t have the armor and swords they desired. They saw the camp of the Gentiles strong and fortified, with cavalry all around it; and these were expert in war. Judas said to the men who were with him, “Don’t be afraid of their numbers, or when they charge. Remember how our fathers were saved in the Red sea, when Pharaoh pursued them with an army. Now let’s cry to heaven, if he will have us, and will remember the covenant of our fathers, and destroy this army before our face today. Then all the Gentiles will know that there is one who redeems and saves Israel.

The foreigners lifted up their eyes, and saw them coming near them. They went out of the camp to battle. Those who were with Judas sounded their trumpets and joined battle. The Gentiles were defeated, and fled into the plain. But all those in the rear fell by the sword. They pursued them to Gazara, and to the plains of Idumaea, Azotus, and Jamnia. About three thousand of those men fell. Then Judas and his army returned from pursuing them; and he said to the people, “Don’t be greedy for the spoils, because there is a battle before us. Gorgias and his army are near us on the mountain. But stand now against our enemies and fight against them, and afterwards take the spoils with boldness.” While Judas was finishing this speech, a part of them appeared looking out from the mountain. They saw that their army had been put to flight, and that the Jews were burning the camp; for the smoke that was seen declared what was done. But when they perceived these things, they were very afraid. Perceiving also the army of Judas in the plain ready for battle, they all fled into the land of the Philistines. Judas returned to plunder the camp, and they took much gold, silver, blue, sea purple, and great riches. Then they returned home, and sang a song of thanksgiving, and gave praise to heaven, because he is good, because his mercy endures forever. Israel had a great deliverance that day.

The foreigners who had escaped came and told Lysias all the things that had happened. When he heard of it, he was confounded and discouraged, because the things he desired had not been done to Israel, nor had such things happened as the king commanded him.

In the next year, he gathered together sixty thousand chosen infantry and five thousand cavalry, that he might subdue them. They came into Idumaea and encamped at Bethsura. Judas met them with ten thousand men. He saw that the army was strong, and he prayed and said, “Blessed are you, O Savior of Israel, who defeated the attack of the mighty warrior by the hand of your servant David, and delivered the army of the Philistines into the hands of Jonathan the son of Saul, and of his armor bearer. Hem in this army in the hand of your people Israel, and let them be ashamed for their army and their cavalry. Give them faintness of heart. Cause the boldness of their strength to melt away, and let them quake at their destruction. Strike them down with the sword of those who love you, and let all who know your name praise you with thanksgiving.”

They joined in battle; and about five thousand men of Lysias’ army fell. They fell down near them. But when Lysias saw that his troops were put to flight, and the boldness that had come upon those who were with Judas, and how they were ready either to live or to die nobly, he withdrew to Antioch, and gathered together hired soldiers, that he might come again into Judea with an even greater army.

But Judas and his kindred said, “Behold, our enemies are defeated. Let’s go up to cleanse the holy place and to rededicate it.” All the army was gathered together, and they went up to mount Zion. They saw the sanctuary laid desolate, the altar profaned, the gates burned up, shrubs growing in the courts as in a forest or as on one of the mountains, and the priests’ chambers pulled down; and they tore their clothes, made great lamentation, put ashes upon their heads, fell on their faces to the ground, blew with the solemn trumpets, and cried toward heaven. Then Judas appointed certain men to fight against those who were in the citadel until he had cleansed the holy place.

He chose blameless priests who were devoted to the law; and they cleansed the holy place and carried the defiled stones out to an unclean place. They deliberated what to do with the altar of burnt offerings, which had been profaned. A good plan came into their mind, that they should pull it down, lest it would be a reproach to them, because the Gentiles had defiled it. So they pulled down the altar and laid up the stones on the temple hill in a convenient place, until a prophet would come to give an answer concerning them. They took whole stones according to the law, and built a new altar like the former. They built the holy place and the inner parts of the house; and they consecrated the courts. They made new holy vessels, and they brought the lampstand, the altar of incense, and the table into the temple. They burned incense on the altar, and they lit the lamps that were upon the lampstand, and they gave light in the temple. They set loaves upon the table, hung up the curtains, and finished all the work which they had done.

They rose up early in the morning, on the twenty-fifth day of the ninth month, which is the month Chislev, in the one hundred forty eighth year, and offered sacrifice according to the law on the new altar of burnt offerings which they had made. At the time and day the Gentiles had profaned it, even then it was dedicated with songs, harps, lutes, and with cymbals. All the people fell on their faces, worshiped, and gave praise toward heaven, which had given them good success. They celebrated the dedication of the altar eight days, and offered burnt offerings with gladness, and sacrificed a sacrifice of deliverance and praise. They decorated the front of the temple with crowns of gold and small shields. They dedicated the gates and the priests’ chambers, and made doors for them. There was exceedingly great gladness among the people, and the reproach of the Gentiles was turned away.

Judas and his kindred and the whole congregation of Israel ordained that the days of the dedication of the altar should be kept in their seasons from year to year for eight days, from the twenty-fifth day of the month Chislev, with gladness and joy.

At that time, they fortified mount Zion with high walls and strong towers around it, lest perhaps the Gentiles might come and trample them down, as they had done before. Judas stationed a garrison to guard it. They fortified Bethsura to keep it, that the people might have a stronghold near Idumaea.

### Chapter 5

It came to pass, when the Gentiles all around heard that the altar had been rebuilt and the sanctuary dedicated as before, they were exceedingly angry. They took counsel to destroy the race of Jacob that was in the midst of them, and they began to kill and destroy among the people. Judas fought against the children of Esau in Idumaea at Akrabattine, because they besieged Israel. He struck them with a great slaughter, humbled them, and took their spoils. He remembered the wickedness of the children of Baean, who were a snare and a stumbling block to the people, lying in wait for them on the highways. They were shut up by him in the towers. He encamped against them, and destroyed them utterly, and burned with fire the towers of the place with all who were in them. He passed over to the children of Ammon, and found a mighty band and many people, with Timotheus for their leader. He fought many battles with them, and they were defeated before his face. He struck them, and took possession of Jazer and its villages, and returned again into Judea.

The Gentiles who were in Gilead gathered themselves together against the Israelites who were on their borders, to destroy them. They fled to the stronghold of Dathema, and sent letters to Judas and his kindred, saying, “The Gentiles who are around us are gathered together against us to destroy us. They are preparing to come and get possession of the stronghold where we fled for refuge, and Timotheus is the leader of their army. Now therefore come and deliver us from their hand, for many of us have fallen. All our kindred who were in the land of Tubias have been put to death. They have carried their wives, their children, and their stuff into captivity. They destroyed about a thousand men there.”

While the letters were still being read, behold, other messengers came from Galilee with their clothes torn, bringing a similar report, saying, “People of Ptolemais, of Tyre, of Sidon, and all Galilee of the Gentiles have gathered together to destroy us.”

Now when Judas and the people heard these words, a great congregation assembled together to determine what they should do for their kindred who were in distress and under attack. Judas said to Simon his brother, “Choose men and go deliver your kindred who are in Galilee, but Jonathan my brother and I will go into the land of Gilead.” He left Joseph the son of Zacharias, and Azarias, as leaders of the people, with the remnant of the army, in Judea, to guard it. He commanded them, saying, “Take charge of this people, and fight no battle with the Gentiles until we return.” Then three thousand men were assigned to go into Galilee with Simon, but eight thousand men were assigned to Judas to go into the land of Gilead.

Simon went into Galilee and fought many battles with the Gentiles, and the Gentiles were defeated before him. He pursued them to the gate of Ptolemais. About three thousand men of the Gentiles fell, and he took their spoils. They took to them those who were in Galilee and in Arbatta, with their wives, their children, and all that they had, and brought them into Judea with great gladness. Judas Maccabaeus and his brother Jonathan passed over the Jordan, and went three days’ journey in the wilderness. They met with the Nabathaeans, and these met them in a peaceful manner and told them all things that had happened to their kindred in the land of Gilead, and how many of them were shut up in Bosora, Bosor, Alema, Casphor, Maked, and Carnaim—all these cities are strong and large— and how they were shut up in the rest of the cities of the land of Gilead, and that tomorrow they planned to encamp against the strongholds, and to take them, and to destroy all these men in one day.

Judas and his army turned suddenly by the way of the wilderness to Bosora; and he took the city, and killed all the males with the edge of the sword, took all their spoils, and burned the city with fire. He left there at night, and went until he came to the stronghold. When the morning came, they lifted up their eyes and saw many people who couldn’t be counted, bearing ladders and engines of war, to take the stronghold; and they were fighting against them. Judas saw that the battle had begun, and that the cry of the city went up to heaven, with trumpets and a great sound, and he said to the men of his army, “Fight today for your kindred!” Then he went out behind them in three companies. They sounded with their trumpets and cried out in prayer. And the army of Timotheus perceived that it was Maccabaeus, and they fled from before him. He struck them with a great slaughter. About eight thousand men of them fell on that day.

He turned away to Mizpeh and fought against it, took it, killed all its males, took its spoils, and burned it with fire. From there he marched and took Casphor, Maked, Bosor, and the other cities of the land of Gilead.

Now after these things, Timotheus gathered another army and encamped near Raphon beyond the brook. Judas sent men to spy on the army; and they brought him word, saying, “All the Gentiles who are around us are gathered together to them, an exceedingly great army. They have hired Arabians to help them, and are encamped beyond the brook, ready to come against you to battle.” So Judas went to meet them.

Timotheus said to the captains of his army when Judas and his army drew near to the brook of water, “If he crosses over to us first, we won’t be able to withstand him, for he will certainly defeat us; but if he is afraid, and encamps beyond the river, we will cross over to him, and defeat him.” Now when Judas came near to the water brook, he caused the scribes of the people to remain by the brook, and commanded them, saying, “Allow no man to encamp, but let all come to the battle.” Then he crossed over the first against them, and all the people after him; and all the Gentiles were defeated before his face, and threw away their weapons, and fled to the temple at Carnaim. They took the city and burned the temple with fire, together with all who were in it. Carnaim was subdued. They couldn’t stand any longer before the face of Judas.

Judas gathered together all Israel, those who were in the land of Gilead, from the least to the greatest, with their wives, their children, and their stuff, an exceedingly great army, that they might come into the land of Judah. They came as far as Ephron, and this same city was large and very strong. It was on the road where they were going. They couldn’t turn away from it on the right hand or on the left, but needed to pass through the middle of it. The people of the city shut them out and blocked the gates with stones. Judas sent to them with words of peace, saying, “We will pass through your land to go into our own land, and no one will harm you. We will only pass by on our feet.” But they wouldn’t open to him. Then Judas commanded proclamation to be made in the army, that each man should encamp in the place where he was. So the men of the army encamped, and fought against the city all that day and all that night, and the city was delivered into his hands. He destroyed all the males with the edge of the sword, razed the city, took its plunder, and passed through the city over those who were slain. They went over the Jordan into the great plain near Bethshan. And Judas gathered together those who lagged behind and encouraged the people all the way through, until he came into the land of Judah. They went up to mount Zion with gladness and joy, and offered whole burnt offerings, because not so much as one of them was slain until they returned in peace.

In the days when Judas and Jonathan were in the land of Gilead, and Simon his brother in Galilee before Ptolemais, Joseph the son of Zacharias, and Azarias, rulers of the army, heard of their exploits and of the war, and what things they had done. They said, “Let’s also get us a name, and let’s go fight against the Gentiles who are around us.” So they gave orders to the men of the army that was with them, and went toward Jamnia. Gorgias and his men came out of the city to meet them in battle. Joseph and Azarias were put to flight, and were pursued to the borders of Judea. About two thousand men of Israel fell on that day. There was a great overthrow among the people, because they didn’t listen to Judas and his kindred, thinking to do some exploit. But they were not of the family of those men by whose hand deliverance was given to Israel.

The man Judas and his kindred were glorified exceedingly in the sight of all Israel, and of all the Gentiles, wherever their name was heard of. Men gathered together to them, acclaiming them.

Judas and his kindred went out and fought against the children of Esau in the land toward the south. He struck Hebron and its villages, pulled down its strongholds, and burned its towers all around. He marched to go into the land of the Philistines, and he went through Samaria. In that day certain priests, desiring to do exploits there, were slain in battle, when they went out to battle unadvisedly. But Judas turned toward Azotus, to the land of the Philistines, pulled down their altars, burned the carved images of their gods with fire, took the plunder of their cities, and returned into the land of Judah.

### Chapter 6

King Antiochus was traveling through the upper countries; and he heard that in Elymais in Persia there was a city renowned for riches, for silver and gold, and that the temple which was in it was exceedingly rich, and that in it were golden shields, breastplates, and weapons which Alexander, son of Philip, the Macedonian king, who reigned first among the Greeks, left behind there. So he came and tried to take the city and to pillage it; and he was not able, because his plan was known to them of the city, and they rose up against him in battle. He fled and returned to Babylon with great disappointment.

Then someone came into Persia bringing him news that the armies which went against the land of Judah had been put to flight, and that Lysias went first with a strong army and was put to shame before them, and that they had grown strong because of weapons, power, and a supply of plunder which they took from the armies that they had cut off, and that they had pulled down the abomination which he had built upon the altar that was in Jerusalem, and that they had surrounded the sanctuary with high walls, as before, and also Bethsura, his city.

It came to pass, when the king heard these words, he was astonished and moved exceedingly. He laid himself down on his bed, and fell sick for grief, because it had not turned out for him as he had planned. He was there many days, because great grief continually gripped him, and he realized that he would die. He called for all his friends, and said to them, “Sleep departs from my eyes, and my heart fails because of worry. I said in my heart, ‘To what suffering I have come! How great a flood it is that I’m in, now! For I was gracious and loved in my power.’ But now I remember the evils which I did at Jerusalem, and that I took all the vessels of silver and gold that were in it, and sent out to destroy the inhabitants of Judah without a cause. I perceive that it is because of this that these evils have come upon me. Behold, I am perishing through great grief in a strange land.”

Then he called for Philip, one of his friends, and set him over all his kingdom. He gave him his crown, his robe, and his signet ring, so that he could guide Antiochus his son, and nourish him up that he might be king. Then King Antiochus died there in the one hundred forty-ninth year. When Lysias learned that the king was dead, he set up Antiochus his son to reign, whom he had nourished up being young, and he called his name Eupator.

Those who were in the citadel kept hemming Israel in around the sanctuary, and always sought to harm them and to strengthen the Gentiles. Judas planned to destroy them, and called all the people together to besiege them. They were gathered together, and besieged them in the one hundred fiftieth year, and he made mounds to shoot from, and engines of war. Some of those who were hemmed in came out, and some of the ungodly men of Israel were joined to them. They went to the king, and said, “How long will you not execute judgment, and avenge our kindred? We were willing to serve your father and to live by his words, and to follow his commandments. Because of this, the children of our people besieged the citadel and were alienated from us; but as many of us as they could catch, they killed, and plundered our inheritances. Not against us only did they stretch out their hand, but also against all their borders. Behold, they are encamped this day against the citadel at Jerusalem to take it. They have fortified the sanctuary and Bethsura. If you don’t quickly prevent them, they will do greater things than these, and you won’t be able to control them.

When the king heard this, he was angry, and gathered together all his friends, the rulers of his army, and those who were over the cavalry. Bands of hired soldiers came to him from other kingdoms and from islands of the sea. The number of his forces was one hundred thousand infantry, and twenty thousand cavalry, and thirty-two elephants trained for war. They went through Idumaea, and encamped against Bethsura, and fought against it many days, and made engines of war. The Jews came out and burned them with fire, and fought valiantly.

Judas marched away from the citadel and encamped at Bethzacharias, near the king’s camp. The king rose early in the morning, and marched his army at full speed along the road to Bethzacharias. His forces made themselves ready to battle and sounded their trumpets. They offered the elephants the juice of grapes and mulberries, that they might prepare them for the battle. They distributed the animals among the phalanxes. They set by each elephant a thousand men armed with coats of mail and helmets of brass on their heads. Five hundred chosen cavalry were appointed for each elephant. These were ready beforehand, wherever the elephant was. Wherever the elephant went, they went with it. They didn’t leave it. Strong, covered wooden towers were upon them, one upon each elephant, fastened upon it with secure harnesses. Upon each were four valiant men who fought upon them, beside his Indian driver. The rest of the cavalry he set on this side and that side on the two flanks of the army, striking terror into the enemy, and protected by the phalanxes. Now when the sun shone upon the shields of gold and brass, the mountains lit up, and blazed like flaming torches.

A part of the king’s army was spread upon the high hills and some on the low ground, and they went on firmly and in order. All who heard the noise of their multitude, the marching of the multitude, and the rattling of the weapons trembled; for the army was exceedingly great and strong. Judas and his army drew near for battle, and six hundred men of the king’s army fell. Eleazar, who was called Avaran, saw one of the animals armed with royal breastplates, and it was taller than all the animals, and the king seemed to be on it. He gave his life to deliver his people, and to get himself an everlasting name. He ran upon him courageously into the midst of the phalanx, and killed on the right hand and on the left, and they parted away from him on this side and on that. He crept under the elephant, and stabbed it from beneath, and killed it. The elephant fell to the earth upon him, and he died there. They saw the strength of the kingdom and the fierce attack of the army, and turned away from them.

But the soldiers of the king’s army went up to Jerusalem to meet them, and the king encamped toward Judea and toward mount Zion. He made peace with the people of Bethsura. He came out of the city because they had no food there to endure the siege, because it was a Sabbath to the land. The king took Bethsura, and appointed a garrison there to keep it. He encamped against the sanctuary many days; and set there mounds to shoot from, and engines of war, and machines for throwing fire and stones, and weapons to throw darts, and slings. The Jews also made engines of war against their engines, and fought for many days. But there was no food in the sanctuary, because it was the seventh year, and those who fled for safety into Judea from among the Gentiles had eaten up the rest of the stores. There were only a few people left in the sanctuary, because the famine prevailed against them, and they were scattered, each man to his own place.

Lysias heard that Philip, whom Antiochus the king, while he was yet alive, appointed to raise his son Antiochus to be king, had returned from Persia and Media, and with him the forces that went with the king, and that he was seeking to take control of the government. He made haste, and gave orders to depart. He said to the king and the leaders of the army and to the men, “We get weaker daily, our food is scant, the place where we encamp is strong, and the affairs of the kingdom lie upon us. Now therefore let’s negotiate with these men, and make peace with them and with all their nation, and covenant with them, that they may walk after their own laws, as before; for because of their laws which we abolished they were angered, and did all these things.”

The speech pleased the king and the princes, and he sent to them to make peace; and they accepted it. The king and the princes swore to them. On these conditions, they came out from the stronghold. Then the king entered into mount Zion. He saw the strength of the place, and broke the oath which he had sworn, and gave orders to pull down the wall all around. Then he left in haste and returned to Antioch, and found Philip master of the city. He fought against him, and took the city by force.

### Chapter 7

In the one hundred fifty first year, Demetrius the son of Seleucus came out of Rome, and went up with a few men to a city by the sea, and reigned there. It came to pass, when he would go into the house of the kingdom of his fathers, that the army laid hands on Antiochus and Lysias, to bring them to him. The thing became known to him, and he said, “Don’t show me their faces!” So the army killed them. Then Demetrius sat upon the throne of his kingdom.

All the lawless and ungodly men of Israel came to him. Alcimus was their leader, desiring to be high priest. They accused the people to the king, saying, “Judas and his kindred have destroyed all your friends, and have scattered us from our own land. Now therefore send a man whom you trust, and let him go and see all the destruction which he has brought on us and the king’s country, and how he has punished them and all who helped them.” So the king chose Bacchides, one of the king’s friends, who was ruler in the country beyond the river, and was a great man in the kingdom, and faithful to the king. He sent him and that ungodly Alcimus, whom he made the high priest; and he commanded him to take vengeance upon the children of Israel.

They marched away and came with a great army into the land of Judah. He sent messengers to Judas and his kindred with words of peace deceitfully. They paid no attention to their words; for they saw that they had come with a great army. A group of scribes gathered together to Alcimus and Bacchides to seek just terms. The Hasidaeans were the first among the children of Israel who sought peace from them, for they said, “One who is a priest of the seed of Aaron has come with the army, and he will do us no wrong.” He spoke with them words of peace, and swore to them, saying, “We won’t seek to harm you or your friends.” They trusted him. Then he seized sixty men of them, and killed them in one day, according to the word which was written,

The flesh of your saints

and their blood was shed all around Jerusalem,

and there was no one to bury them.

The fear and the dread of them fell upon all the people, for they said, “There is neither truth nor justice in them; for they have broken the covenant and the oath which they swore.” Bacchides withdrew from Jerusalem, and encamped in Bezeth. He sent and seized many of the deserters who were with him, and some of the people, and he killed them, throwing them into a large pit. He placed Alcimus in charge of the country and left with him a force to aid him. Then Bacchides went away to the king.

Alcimus struggled to maintain his high priesthood. All those who troubled their people joined him, and they took control of the land of Judah, and did great damage in Israel. Judas saw all the wrongs that Alcimus and his company had done among the children of Israel, even more than the Gentiles. He went out into all the borders of Judea and took vengeance on the men who had deserted from him, and they were restrained from going out into the country. But when Alcimus saw that Judas and his company had grown strong, and knew that he was not able to withstand them, he returned to the king, and brought evil accusations against them.

Then the king sent Nicanor, one of his honorable princes, a man who hated Israel and was their enemy, and commanded him to destroy the people. Nicanor came to Jerusalem with a great army. He sent to Judas and his kindred deceitfully with words of peace, saying, “Let there be no battle between me and you; I will come with a few men, that I may see your faces in peace.” He came to Judas, and they saluted one another peaceably. The enemies were ready to seize Judas by violence. This was known to Judas, that he came to him with deceit, and he was very afraid of him, and would see his face no more. Nicanor found out that his plan was disclosed; and he went out to meet Judas in battle beside Capharsalama. About five hundred men of Nicanor’s army fell, and the rest fled into the city of David.

After these things, Nicanor went up to mount Zion. Some of the priests came out of the sanctuary, with some of the elders of the people, to salute him peaceably, and to show him the whole burned sacrifice that was being offered for the king. He mocked them, laughed at them, derided them shamefully, spoke arrogantly, and swore in a rage, saying, “Unless Judas and his army are now delivered into my hands, it shall be that, if I return safely, I will burn up this house!” And he went out in a great rage. The priests entered in, and stood before the altar and the temple; and they wept, and said, “You chose this house to be called by your name, to be a house of prayer and supplication for your people. Take vengeance on this man and his army, and let them fall by the sword. Remember their blasphemies, and don’t allow them to live any longer.”

Then Nicanor went out from Jerusalem and encamped in Bethhoron, and there the Syrian army met him. Judas encamped in Adasa with three thousand men. Judas prayed and said, “When those who came from the king blasphemed, your angel went out, and struck among them one hundred eighty-five thousand. Even so, crush this army before us today, and let all the rest know that he has spoken wickedly against your sanctuary. Judge him according to his wickedness.” On the thirteenth day of the month Adar, the armies met in battle. Nicanor’s army was defeated, and he himself was the first to fall in the battle. Now when his army saw that Nicanor had fallen, they threw away their weapons and fled. They pursued them a day’s journey from Adasa until you come to Gazara, and they sounded an alarm after them with the signal trumpets. Men came out of all the surrounding villages of Judea, and outflanked them. These turned them back on those, and they all fell by the sword. There wasn’t one of them left. The Jews took the spoils and the booty, and they cut off Nicanor’s head and his right hand, which he had stretched out so arrogantly, and brought them, and hung them up beside Jerusalem. The people were exceedingly glad, and they kept that day as a day of great gladness. They ordained to keep this day year by year on the thirteenth day of Adar. So the land of Judah had rest a few days.

### Chapter 8

Judas heard of the fame of the Romans, that they are valiant men, and have pleasure in all who join themselves to them, and make friends with all who come to them, and that they are valiant men. They told him of their wars and exploits which they do among the Gauls, and how they conquered them, and forced them to pay tribute; and what things they did in the land of Spain, that they might take control of the silver and gold mines which were there; and how by their policy and persistence they conquered all the place (and the place was exceedingly far from them), and the kings who came against them from the uttermost part of the earth, until they had defeated them, and struck them severely; and how the rest give them tribute year by year. Philip, and Perseus, king of Chittim, and those who lifted up themselves against them, they defeated in battle, and conquered them. Antiochus also, the great king of Asia, came against them to battle, having one hundred twenty elephants, with cavalry, chariots, and an exceedingly great army, and he was defeated by them. They took him alive, and decreed that both he and those who reigned after him should give them a great tribute, and should give hostages, and a parcel of land from the best of their provinces: the countries of India, Media, and Lydia. They took them from him, and gave them to King Eumenes. Judas heard how the Greeks planned to come and destroy them, but this became known to them, and they sent against them a general who fought against them, and many of them fell down wounded to death, and they made captive their wives and their children, and plundered them, and conquered their land, and pulled down their strongholds, and plundered them, and brought them into bondage to this day. The remaining kingdoms and islands, as many as rose up against them at any time, they destroyed and made them to be their servants; but with their friends and those who relied on them they stayed friends. They conquered the kingdoms that were near and those that were far off, and all that heard of their fame were afraid of them. Moreover, whoever they desired to help and to make kings, these they make kings; and whoever they desired, they depose. They are exalted exceedingly. For all this, none of them ever put on a crown, neither did they clothe themselves with purple, as a display of grandeur. Judas heard how they had made for themselves a senate house, and day by day, three hundred twenty men sat in council, consulting always for the people, to the end they might be well governed, and how they commit their government to one man year by year, that he should rule over them, and control all their country, and all are obedient to that one, and there is neither envy nor emulation among them.

So Judas chose Eupolemus the son of John, the son of Accos, and Jason the son of Eleazar, and sent them to Rome, to establish friendship and alliance with them, and that they should free the yoke from themselves; for they saw that the kingdom of the Greeks kept Israel in bondage. Then they went to Rome, a very long journey, and they entered into the senate house, and said, “Judas, who is also called Maccabaeus, and his kindred, and the people of the Jews, have sent us to you, to make an alliance and peace with you, and that we might be registered as your allies and friends.”

This thing was pleasing to them. This is the copy of the writing which they wrote back again on tables of brass, and sent to Jerusalem, that it might be with them there for a memorial of peace and alliance:

“Good success be to the Romans, and to the nation of the Jews, by sea and by land forever. May the sword and the enemy be far from them. But if war arises for Rome first, or any of their allies in all their dominion, the nation of the Jews shall help them as allies, as the occasion shall indicate to them, with all their heart. To those who make war upon them, they shall not give supplies, food, weapons, money, or ships, as it has seemed good to Rome, and they shall keep their ordinances without taking anything in return. In the same way, moreover, if war comes first upon the nation of the Jews, the Romans shall willingly help them as allies, as the occasion shall indicate to them; and to those who are fighting with them, there shall not be given food, weapons, money, or ships, as it has seemed good to Rome. They shall keep these ordinances, and that without deceit. According to these terms, the Romans made a treaty with the Jewish people. But if hereafter the one party and the other shall determine to add or diminish anything, they shall do it at their pleasure, and whatever they add or take away shall be ratified.

Concerning the evils which King Demetrius is doing to them, we have written to him, saying, ‘Why have you made your yoke heavy on our friends and allies the Jews? If therefore they plead any more against you, we will do them justice, and fight with you on sea and on land.’”

### Chapter 9

Demetrius heard that Nicanor had fallen with his forces in battle, and he sent Bacchides and Alcimus again into the land of Judah a second time, and the right wing of his army with them. They went by the way that leads to Gilgal, and encamped against Mesaloth, which is in Arbela, and took possession of it, and killed many people. The first month of the one hundred fifty-second year, they encamped against Jerusalem. Then they marched away and went to Berea with twenty thousand infantry and two thousand cavalry. Judas was encamped at Elasa with three thousand chosen men. They saw the multitude of the forces, that they were many, and they were terrified. Many slipped away out of the army. There were not left of them more than eight hundred men.

Judas saw that his army slipped away and that the battle pressed upon him, and he was very troubled in spirit, because he had no time to gather them together, and he became faint. He said to those who were left, “Let’s arise and go up against our adversaries, if perhaps we may be able to fight with them.”

They tried to dissuade him, saying, “There is no way we are able; but let’s rather save our lives now. Let’s return again with our kindred, and fight against them; but we are too few.”

Judas said, “Let it not be so that I should do this thing, to flee from them. If our time has come, let’s die in a manly way for our kindred’s sake, and not leave a cause of reproach against our honor.”

The army marched out from the camp, and stood to encounter them. The cavalry was divided into two companies, and the slingers and the archers went before the army, and all the mighty men that fought in the front of the battle. Bacchides was in the right wing. The phalanx advanced on the two parts, and they blew with their trumpets. The men by Judas’ side sounded with their trumpets, and the earth shook with the shout of the armies, and the battle was joined, and continued from morning until evening.

Judas saw that Bacchides and the strength of his army were on the right side, and all that were brave in heart went with him, and the right wing was defeated by them, and he pursued after them to the mount Azotus. Those who were on the left wing saw that the right wing was defeated, and they turned and followed in the footsteps of Judas and of those who were with him. The battle became desparate, and many on both sides fell wounded to death. Judas fell, and the rest fled.

Jonathan and Simon took Judas their brother, and buried him in the tomb of his ancestors at Modin. They wept for him. All Israel made great lamentation for him, and mourned many days, and said, “How is the mighty fallen, the savior of Israel!” The rest of the acts of Judas, and his wars, and the valiant deeds which he did, and his greatness, are not written; for they were exceedingly many.

It came to pass after the death of Judas, that the lawless emerged within all the borders of Israel. All those who did iniquity rose up. In those days there was an exceedingly great famine, and the country went over to their side. Bacchides chose the ungodly men and made them rulers of the country. They inquired and searched for the friends of Judas, and brought them to Bacchides, and he took vengeance on them and used them despitefully. There was great suffering in Israel, such as was not since the time prophets stopped appearing to them.

All the friends of Judas were gathered together, and they said to Jonathan, “Since your brother Judas has died, we have no man like him to go out against our enemies and Bacchides, and among those of our nation who hate us. Now therefore we have chosen you this day to be our prince and leader in his place, that you may fight our battles.” So Jonathan took the governance upon him at that time, and rose up in the place of his brother Judas.

When Bacchides found out, he tried to kill him. Jonathan, and Simon his brother, and all who were with him, knew it; and they fled into the wilderness of Tekoah, and encamped by the water of the pool of Asphar. Bacchides found this out on the Sabbath day, and came—he and all his army—over the Jordan.

Jonathan sent his brother, a leader of the multitude, and implored his friends the Nabathaeans, that they might store their baggage, which was much, with them. The children of Jambri came out of Medaba, and seized John and all that he had, and went their way with it.

But after these things, they brought word to Jonathan and Simon his brother that the children of Jambri were celebrating a great wedding, and were bringing the bride, a daughter of one of the great nobles of Canaan, from Nadabath with a large escort. They remembered John their brother, and went up, and hid themselves under the cover of the mountain. They lifted up their eyes and looked, and saw a great procession with much baggage. The bridegroom came out with his friends and his kindred to meet them with timbrels, musicians, and many weapons. They rose up against them from their ambush and killed them, and many fell wounded to death. The remnant fled into the mountain, and the Jews took all their spoils. So the wedding was turned into mourning, and the voice of their musicians into lamentation. They avenged fully the blood of their brother, and turned back to the marshes of the Jordan.

Bacchides heard it, and he came on the Sabbath day to the banks of Jordan with a great army. Jonathan said to his company, “Let’s stand up now and fight for our lives, for things are different today than they were yesterday and the day before. For, behold, the battle is before us and behind us. Moreover the water of the Jordan is on this side and on that side, and marsh and thicket. There is no place to escape. Now therefore cry to heaven, that you may be delivered out of the hand of your enemies.” So the battle was joined, and Jonathan stretched out his hand to strike Bacchides, and he turned away back from him. Jonathan and those who were with him leapt into the Jordan, and swam over to the other side. The enemy didn’t pass over the Jordan against them. About a thousand men of Bacchides’ company fell that day; and he returned to Jerusalem. They built strong cities in Judea, the stronghold that was in Jericho, and Emmaus, Bethhoron, Bethel, Timnath, Pharathon, and Tephon, with high walls and gates and bars. He set garrisons in them to harass Israel. He fortified the city Bethsura, Gazara, and the citadel, and put troops and stores of food in them. He took the sons of the chief men of the country for hostages, and put them under guard in the citadel at Jerusalem.

And in the one hundred fifty-third year, in the second month, Alcimus gave orders to pull down the wall of the inner court of the sanctuary. He also pulled down the works of the prophets. He began to pull down. At that time was Alcimus stricken, and his works were hindered; and his mouth was stopped, and he was taken with a palsy, and he could no more speak anything and give orders concerning his house. Alcimus died at that time with great torment. Bacchides saw that Alcimus was dead, and he returned to the king. Then the land of Judah had rest for two years.

Then all the lawless men took counsel, saying, “Behold, Jonathan and his men are dwelling at ease and in security. Now therefore we will bring Bacchides, and he will capture them all in one night. They went and consulted with him. He marched out and came with a great army, and sent letters secretly to all his allies who were in Judea, that they should seize Jonathan and those who were with him; but they couldn’t, because their plan was known to them. Jonathan’s men seized about fifty of the men of the country who were authors of the wickedness, and he killed them. Jonathan, Simon, and those who were with him, went away to Bethbasi, which is in the wilderness, and he built up that which had been pulled down, and they made it strong. Bacchides found out about it, and he gathered together all his multitude, and sent orders to those who were of Judea. He went and encamped against Bethbasi and fought against it many days, and made engines of war.

Jonathan left his brother Simon in the city, and went out into the country, and he went with a few men. He struck Odomera and his kindred, and the children of Phasiron in their tents. They began to strike them, and to go up with their forces. Then Simon and those who were with him went out of the city, and set the engines of war on fire, and fought against Bacchides, and he was defeated by them. They afflicted him severely; for his counsel and expedition was in vain. They were very angry with the lawless men who gave him counsel to come into the country, and they killed many of them. Then he decided to depart into his own land.

Jonathan learned of this and sent ambassadors to him, to the end that they should make peace with him, and that he should restore to them the captives. He accepted the thing, and did according to his words, and swore to him that he would not seek his harm all the days of his life. He restored to him the captives which he had taken before out of the land of Judah, and he returned and departed into his own land, and didn’t come any more into their borders. Thus the sword ceased from Israel. Jonathan lived at Michmash. Jonathan began to judge the people; and he destroyed the ungodly out of Israel.

### Chapter 10

In the one hundred sixtieth year, Alexander Epiphanes, the son of Antiochus, went up and took possession of Ptolemais. They received him, and he reigned there. King Demetrius heard about this, and he gathered together exceedingly great forces, and went out to meet him in battle.

Demetrius sent a letter to Jonathan with words of peace, so as to honor him. For he said, “Let’s go beforehand to make peace with them, before he makes peace with Alexander against us; for he will remember all the evils that we have done against him, and to his kindred and to his nation.” So he gave him authority to gather together forces, and to provide weapons, and that he should be his ally. He also commanded that they should release the hostages that were in the citadel to him.

Jonathan came to Jerusalem, and read the letter in the hearing of all the people, and of those who were in the citadel. They were very afraid when they heard that the king had given him authority to gather together an army. Those in the citadel released the hostages to Jonathan, and he restored them to their parents.

Jonathan lived in Jerusalem and began to build and renew the city. He commanded those who did the work to build the walls and encircle Mount Zion with square stones for defense; and they did so. The foreigners who were in the strongholds which Bacchides had built fled away. Each man left his place and departed into his own land. Only at Bethsura, there were left some of those who had forsaken the law and the commandments, for it was a place of refuge to them.

King Alexander heard all the promises which Demetrius had sent to Jonathan. They told him of the battles and the valiant deeds which he and his kindred had done, and of the troubles which they had endured. So he said, “Could we find another man like him? Now we will make him our friend and ally.” He wrote a letter and sent it to him, in these words, saying, “King Alexander to his brother Jonathan, greetings. We have heard of you, that you are a mighty man of valour, and worthy to be our friend. Now we have appointed you this day to be high priest of your nation, and to be called the king’s friend, and to take our side, and to keep friendship with us.” He also sent to him a purple robe and a golden crown.

And Jonathan put on the holy garments in the seventh month of the one hundred sixtieth year, at the feast of tabernacles; and he gathered together forces and provided weapons in abundance.

When Demetrius heard these things, he was grieved and said, “What is this that we have done, that Alexander has gotten ahead of us in establishing friendship with the Jews to strengthen himself? I also will write to them words of encouragement and of honor and of gifts, that they may be with me to aid me.” So he sent to them this message:

“King Demetrius to the nation of the Jews, greetings. Since as you have kept your covenants with us, and continued in our friendship, and have not joined yourselves to our enemies, we have heard of this, and are glad. Now continue still to keep faith with us, and we will repay you with good in return for your dealings with us. We will grant you many immunities and give you gifts.

“Now I free you and release all the Jews from the tributes, from the salt tax, and from the crown levies. Instead of the third part of the seed, and instead of half of the fruit of the trees, which falls to me to receive, I release it from this day and henceforth, so that I will not take it from the land of Judah, and from the three districts which are added to it from the country of Samaria and Galilee, from this day forth and for all time. Let Jerusalem be holy and free, with her borders, tithes, and taxes. I yield up also my authority over the citadel which is at Jerusalem, and give it to the high priest, that he may appoint in it men whom he chooses to keep it. Every soul of the Jews who has been carried captive from the land of Judah into any part of my kingdom, I set at liberty without payment. Let all officials also cancel the taxes on their livestock.

“All the feasts, the Sabbaths, new moons, appointed days, three days before a feast, and three days after a feast, let them all be days of immunity and release for all the Jews who are in my kingdom. No man shall have authority to exact anything from any of them, or to trouble them concerning any matter.

“Let there be enrolled among the king’s forces about thirty thousand men of the Jews, and pay shall be given to them, as is due to all the king’s forces. Of them, some shall be placed in the king’s great strongholds, and some of them shall be placed over the affairs of the kingdom, which are positions of trust. Let those who are over them and their rulers be of themselves, and let them walk after their own laws, even as the king has commanded in the land of Judah.

“The three districts that have been added to Judea from the country of Samaria, let them be annexed to Judea, that they may be reckoned to be under one ruler, that they may not obey any other authority than the high priest’s. As for Ptolemais and its land, I have given it as a gift to the sanctuary that is at Jerusalem, for the expenses of the sanctuary. I also give every year fifteen thousand shekels of silver from the king’s revenues from the places that are appropriate. And all the additional funds which those who manage the king’s affairs didn’t pay as in the first years, they shall give from now on toward the works of the temple. Besides this, the five thousand shekels of silver which they received from the uses of the sanctuary from the revenue year by year is also released, because it belongs to the priests who minister there. Whoever flees to the temple that is at Jerusalem, and within all of its borders, whether one owe money to the king, or any other matter, let them go free, along with all that they have in my kingdom. For the building and renewing of the structures of the sanctuary, the expense shall also be given out of the king’s revenue. For the building of the walls of Jerusalem and fortifying it all around, the expense shall also be given out of the king’s revenue, also for the building of the walls in Judea.”

Now when Jonathan and the people heard these words, they gave no credence to them, and didn’t accept them, because they remembered the great evil which he had done in Israel, and that he had afflicted them very severely. They were well pleased with Alexander, because he was the first who spoke words of peace to them, and they were allies with him always.

King Alexander gathered together great forces and encamped near Demetrius. The two kings joined battle, and the army of Alexander fled; and Demetrius followed after him, and prevailed against them. He strengthened the battle exceedingly until the sun went down; and Demetrius fell that day.

Alexander sent ambassadors to Ptolemy king of Egypt with this message: “Since I have returned to my kingdom, and am seated on the throne of my fathers, and have established my dominion, and have overthrown Demetrius, and have taken possession of our country— yes, I joined the battle with him, and he and his army were defeated by us, and we sat on the throne of his kingdom— now also let’s make friends with one another. Give me now your daughter as my wife. I will be joined with you, and will give both you and her gifts worthy of you.”

Ptolemy the king answered, saying, “Happy is the day you returned to the land of your ancestors and sat on the throne of their kingdom. Now I will do to you as you have written, but meet me at Ptolemais, that we may see one another; and I will join with you, even as you have said.” So Ptolemy went out of Egypt, himself and Cleopatra his daughter, and came to Ptolemais in the one hundred sixty-second year. King Alexander met him, and he gave him his daughter Cleopatra, and celebrated her wedding at Ptolemais with great pomp, as kings do.

King Alexander wrote to Jonathan, that he should come to meet him. He went with pomp to Ptolemais, and met the two kings. He gave them and their friends silver and gold, and many gifts, and found favor in their sight. Some malcontents out of Israel, men who were transgressors of the law, gathered together against him to complain against him; but the king paid no attention to them. The king commanded that they take off Jonathan’s garments and clothe him in purple, and they did so. The king made him sit with him, and said to his princes, “Go out with him into the midst of the city, and proclaim that no man may complain against him of any matter, and let no man trouble him for any reason.” It came to pass, when those who complained against him saw his honor according to the proclamation, and saw him clothed in purple, they all fled away. The king gave him honor, and enrolled him among his chief friends, and made him a captain and governor of a province. Then Jonathan returned to Jerusalem with peace and gladness.

In the one hundred sixty-fifth year, Demetrius, son of Demetrius, came out of Crete into the land of his ancestors. When King Alexander heard of it, he grieved exceedingly and returned to Antioch. Demetrius appointed Apollonius, who was over Coelesyria, and he gathered together a great army, and encamped against Jamnia, and sent to Jonathan the high priest, saying,

“You alone lift up yourself against us, but I am ridiculed and in reproach because of you. Why do you assume authority against us in the mountains? Now therefore, if you trust in your forces, come down to us into the plain, and let’s match strength with each other there; for the power of the cities is with me. Ask and learn who I am, and the rest who help us. They say, ‘Your foot can’t stand before our face; for your ancestors have been put to flight twice in their own land.’ Now you won’t be able to withstand the cavalry and such an army as this in the plain, where is there is no stone or pebble, or place to flee.”

Now when Jonathan heard the words of Apollonius, he was moved in his mind, and he chose ten thousand men, and went out from Jerusalem; and Simon his brother met him to help him. Then he encamped against Joppa. The people of the city shut him out, because Apollonius had a garrison in Joppa. So they fought against it. The people of the city were afraid, and opened to him; and Jonathan became master of Joppa.

Apollonius heard about that, and he gathered an army of three thousand cavalry, and a great army, and went to Azotus as though he were on a journey, and at the same time advanced onward into the plain, because he had a multitude of cavalry which he trusted. He pursued him to Azotus, and the armies joined battle. Apollonius had secretly left a thousand cavalry behind them. Jonathan learned that there was an ambush behind him. They surrounded his army, and shot their arrows at the people, from morning until evening; but the people stood fast, as Jonathan commanded them; and the enemy’s horses grew tired.

Then Simon brought forward his army and joined battle with the phalanx (for the cavalry were exhausted), and they were defeated by him and fled. The cavalry were scattered in the plain. They fled to Azotus and entered into Beth-dagon, their idol’s temple, to save themselves. Jonathan burned Azotus and the cities around it and took their spoils. He burned the temple of Dagon and those who fled into it with fire. Those who had fallen by the sword plus those who were burned were about eight thousand men.

From there, Jonathan left and encamped against Ascalon. The people of the city came out to meet him with great pomp. Jonathan, with those who were on his side, returned to Jerusalem, having many spoils. It came to pass, when King Alexander heard these things, he honored Jonathan even more. He sent him a gold buckle, as the custom is to give to the king’s kindred. He gave him Ekron and all its land for a possession.

### Chapter 11

Then the king of Egypt gathered together great forces, as the sand which is by the sea shore, and many ships, and sought to make himself master of Alexander’s kingdom by deceit, and to add it to his own kingdom. He went out into Syria with words of peace, and the people of the cities opened their gates to him and met him; for King Alexander’s command was that they should meet him, because he was his father-in-law. Now as he entered into the cities of Ptolemais, he set his forces for a garrison in each city.

But when he came near to Azotus, they showed him the temple of Dagon burned with fire, and Azotus and its pasture lands destroyed, and the bodies cast out, and those who had been burned, whom he burned in the war, for they had made heaps of them in his way. They told the king what Jonathan had done, that they might cast blame on him; but the king kept silent. Jonathan met the king with pomp at Joppa, and they greeted one another, and they slept there. Jonathan went with the king as far as the river that is called Eleutherus, then returned to Jerusalem.

But King Ptolemy took control of the cities along the sea coast, to Selucia which is by the sea, and he devised evil plans concerning Alexander. He sent ambassadors to King Demetrius, saying, “Come! Let’s make a covenant with one another, and I will give you my daughter whom Alexander has, and you shall reign over your father’s kingdom; for I regret that I gave my daughter to him, for he tried to kill me. He accused him, because he coveted his kingdom. Taking his daughter from him, he gave her to Demetrius, and was estranged from Alexander, and their enmity was openly seen.

Ptolemy entered into Antioch, and put on himself the crown of Asia. He put two crowns upon his head, the crown of Egypt and that of Asia. But King Alexander was in Cilicia at that time, because the people of that region were in revolt. When Alexander heard of it, he came against him in war. Ptolemy marched out and met him with a strong force, and put him to flight. Alexander fled into Arabia, that he might be sheltered there; but King Ptolemy was triumphant. Zabdiel the Arabian took off Alexander’s head, and sent it to Ptolemy. King Ptolemy died the third day after, and those who were in his strongholds were slain by the inhabitants of the strongholds. Demetrius became king in the one hundred sixty-seventh year.

In those days Jonathan gathered together the Judeans to take the citadel that was at Jerusalem. He made many engines of war to use against it. Some lawless men who hated their own nation went to the king and reported to him that Jonathan was besieging the citadel. He heard, and was angry, but when he heard it, he set out immediately, and came to Ptolemais, and wrote to Jonathan, that he should not besiege it, and that he should meet him and speak with him at Ptolemais with all speed.

But when Jonathan heard this, he gave orders to continue the siege. He chose some of the elders of Israel and of the priests, and put himself in peril by taking silver, gold, clothing, and various other presents, and went to Ptolemais to the king. Then he found favor in his sight. Some lawless men of those who were of the nation made complaints against him, and the king did to him even as his predecessors had done to him, and exalted him in the sight of all his friends, and confirmed to him the high priesthood, and all the other honors that he had before, and gave him preeminence among his chief friends. And Jonathan requested of the king that he would make Judea free from tribute, along with the three provinces and the country of Samaria, and promised him three hundred talents. The king consented, and wrote letters to Jonathan concerning all these things as follows:

“King Demetrius to his brother Jonathan, and to the nation of the Jews, greetings. The copy of the letter which we wrote to Lasthenes our kinsman concerning you, we have written also to you, that you may see it. ‘King Demetrius to Lasthenes his father, greetings. We have determined to do good to the nation of the Jews, who are our friends, and observe what is just toward us, because of their good will toward us. We have confirmed therefore to them the borders of Judea, and also the three governments of Aphaerema, Lydda, and Ramathaim (these were added to Judea from the country of Samaria), and all their territory to them, for all who do sacrifice in Jerusalem, instead of the king’s dues which the king received of them yearly before from the produce of the earth and the fruits of trees. As for the other payments to us from henceforth, of the tithes and the taxes that pertain to us, and the salt pits, and the crown taxes due to us, all these we will give back to them. Not one of these grants shall be annulled from this time forth and forever. Now therefore be careful to make a copy of these things, and let it be given to Jonathan, and let it be set up on the holy mountain in a suitable and conspicuous place.’”

When King Demetrius saw that the land was quiet before him, and that no resistance was made to him, he sent away all his troops, each man to his own place, except the foreign troops, which he had raised from the islands of the Gentiles. So all the troops of his fathers hated him. Now Tryphon was one of those who previously had been on Alexander’s side, and he saw that all the forces murmured against Demetrius. So he went to Imalcue the Arabian, who was raising up Antiochus the young child of Alexander, and urgently insisted to him that he should deliver him to him, that he might reign in his father’s place. He told him all that Demetrius had done, and the hatred with which his forces hated him; and he stayed there many days.

Now Jonathan sent to King Demetrius, that he should remove the troops of the citadel from Jerusalem, and the troops who were in the strongholds; for they fought against Israel continually. Demetrius sent to Jonathan, saying, “I will not only do this for you and your nation, but I will greatly honor you and your nation, if I find an opportunity. Now therefore you shall do well if you send me men who will fight for me; for all my forces have revolted.” So Jonathan sent him three thousand valiant men to Antioch. They came to the king, and the king was glad at their coming.

The people of the city gathered themselves together into the midst of the city, to the number of one hundred and twenty thousand men, and they wanted to kill the king. The king fled into the court of the palace, and the people of the city seized the main streets of the city and began to fight. The king called the Jews to help him, and they were gathered together to him all at once, and they dispersed themselves in the city, and killed that day about one hundred thousand. They set the city on fire, and seized many spoils that day, and saved the king. The people of the city saw that the Jews had taken control of the city as they pleased, and they became faint in their hearts, and they cried out to the king with supplication, saying, “Give us your right hand, and let the Jews cease from fighting against us and the city.” They threw away their weapons and made peace. The Jews were glorified in the sight of the king, and before all who were in his kingdom. Then they returned to Jerusalem, having much plunder. So King Demetrius sat on the throne of his kingdom, and the land was quiet before him. He lied in all that he spoke, and estranged himself from Jonathan, and didn’t repay him according to the benefits with which he had repaid him, and treated him very harshly.

Now after this, Tryphon returned, and with him the young child Antiochus, who reigned and put on a crown. All the forces which Demetrius had sent away with disgrace were gathered to him, and they fought against him, and he fled and was routed. Tryphon took the elephants, and took control of Antioch. The young Antiochus wrote to Jonathan, saying, “I confirm to you the high priesthood, and appoint you over the four districts, and to be one of the king’s friends.” He sent to him golden vessels and furniture for the table, and gave him permission to drink in golden vessels, and to be clothed in purple, and to have a golden buckle. He made his brother Simon governor from the Ladder of Tyre to the borders of Egypt.

Jonathan went out and took his journey beyond the river and through the cities. All the forces of Syria gathered themselves to him to be his allies. He came to Ascalon, and the people of the city met him honorably. He departed from there to Gaza, and the people of Gaza shut him out. So he besieged it and burned its pasture lands with fire, and plundered them. The people of Gaza pleaded with Jonathan, and he gave them his right hand, and took the sons of their princes for hostages, and sent them away to Jerusalem. Then he passed through the country as far as Damascus.

Then Jonathan heard that Demetrius’ princes had come to Kedesh, which is in Galilee, with a great army, intending to remove him from his office. He went to meet them, but he left Simon his brother in the country. Simon encamped against Bethsura, and fought against it many days, and hemmed it in. They asked him to give them his right hand, and he gave it to them. He removed them from there, took possession of the city, and set a garrison over it.

Jonathan and his army encamped at the water of Gennesareth, and early in the morning they marched to the plain of Hazor. Behold, an army of foreigners met him in the plain. They laid an ambush for him in the mountains, but they themselves met him face to face. But those who lay in ambush rose out of their places and joined battle. All those who were on Jonathan’s side fled. Not one of them was left, except Mattathias the son of Absalom, and Judas the son of Chalphi, captains of the forces. Jonathan tore his clothes, put dirt on his head, and prayed. He turned again to them in battle, and routed them, and they fled. When the men on his side who had fled saw this, they returned to him and pursued with him to Kedesh to their camp, and they encamped there. About three thousand men of the foreigners fell on that day. Then Jonathan returned to Jerusalem.

### Chapter 12

Jonathan saw that the time was favorable for him, so he chose men and sent them to Rome to confirm and renew the friendship that they had with them. He also sent similar letters to the Spartans, and to other places. They went to Rome, entered into the senate house, and said, “Jonathan the high priest and the nation of the Jews have sent us to renew for them the friendship and the alliance, as in former time.” They gave them letters to the men in every place, that they should provide safe conduct for them on their way to the land of Judah. This is the copy of the letters which Jonathan wrote to the Spartans:

“Jonathan the high priest, and the senate of the nation, and the priests, and the rest of the people of the Jews, to their kindred the Spartans, greetings. Even before this time letters were sent to Onias the high priest from Arius, who was reigning among you, to signify that you are our kindred, as the copy written below shows. Onias welcomed honorably the man who was sent and received the letters, wherein declaration was made of alliance and friendship. Therefore we also, even though we need none of these things, having for our encouragement the holy books which are in our hands, have undertaken to send that we might renew our brotherhood and friendship with you, to the end that we should not become estranged from you altogether; for a long time has passed since you sent your letter to us. We therefore at all times without ceasing, both in our feasts, and on the other convenient days, remember you in the sacrifices which we offer, and in our prayers, as it is right and proper to be mindful of kindred. Moreover, we are glad for your glory. But as for ourselves, many afflictions and many wars have encompassed us, and the kings who are around us have fought against us. We were unwilling to be troublesome to you, and to the rest of our allies and friends, in these wars; for we have the help which is from heaven to help us, and we have been delivered from our enemies, and our enemies have been humbled. We chose therefore Numenius the son of Antiochus and Antipater the son of Jason, and have sent them to the Romans, to renew the friendship that we had with them, and the former alliance. We commanded them therefore to go also to you, and to salute you, and to deliver you our letters concerning the renewing of friendship and our brotherhood. And now you will do well if you give us a reply.”

And this is the copy of the letters which they sent to Onias:

“Arius king of the Spartans to Onias the chief priest, greetings. It has been found in writing, concerning the Spartans and the Jews, that they are kindred, and that they are of the descendants of Abraham. Now, since this has come to our knowledge, you will do well to write to us of your prosperity. We moreover write on our part to you, that your livestock and goods are ours, and ours are yours. We do command therefore that they make report to you accordingly.”

Now Jonathan heard that Demetrius’ princes had returned to fight against him with a greater army than before, so he marched away from Jerusalem, and met them in the country of Hamath; for he gave them no opportunity to set foot in his country. He sent spies into his camp, and they came again, and reported to him that they were preparing to attack them at night. But as soon as the sun was down, Jonathan commanded his men to watch, and to be armed, that all the night long they might be ready for battle. He stationed sentinels around the camp. The adversaries heard that Jonathan and his men were ready for battle, and they feared, and trembled in their hearts, and they kindled fires in their camp then withdrew. But Jonathan and his men didn’t know it until the morning; for they saw the fires burning. Jonathan pursued after them, but didn’t overtake them; for they had gone over the river Eleutherus. Then Jonathan turned toward the Arabians, who are called Zabadaeans, and struck them, and took their spoils. He came out from there, and came to Damascus, and took his journey through all the country.

Simon went out, and took his journey as far as Ascalon, and the strongholds that were near it. Then he turned toward Joppa and took possession of it; for he had heard that they were planning to hand over the stronghold to Demetrius’ men. He set a garrison there to guard it.

Then Jonathan returned and called the elders of the people together. He planned with them to build strongholds in Judea, and to make the walls of Jerusalem higher, and to raise a great mound between the citadel and the city, to separate it from the city, that so it might be isolated, that its garrison might neither buy nor sell. They were gathered together to build the city. Part of the wall of the brook that is on the east side fell down, and he repaired the section called Chaphenatha. Simon also built Adida in the plain country, made it strong, and set up gates and bars.

And Tryphon sought to reign over Asia and to crown himself, and to stretch out his hand against Antiochus the king. He was afraid that Jonathan wouldn’t allow him, and that he would fight against him; and he sought a way to seize him, that he might destroy him. So he marched out and came to Bethshan. Jonathan came out to meet him with forty thousand men chosen for battle, and came to Bethshan. Tryphon saw that he came with a great army, and he was afraid to stretch out his hand against him. He received him honorably, and commended him to all his friends, and gave him gifts, and commanded his forces to be obedient to him, as to himself. He said to Jonathan, “Why have you put all this people to so much trouble, seeing there is no war between us? Now send them away to their homes, but choose for yourself a few men who shall be with you, and come with me to Ptolemais, and I will give it to you, and the rest of the strongholds and the rest of the forces, and all the king’s officers. Then I will turn around and depart; for this is why I came.”

He put his trust in him, and did even as he said, and sent away his forces, and they departed into the land of Judah. But he reserved to himself three thousand men, of whom he left two thousand in Galilee, but one thousand went with him. Now as soon as Jonathan entered into Ptolemais, the people of Ptolemais shut the gates and seized him. They killed all those who came in with him with the sword.

Tryphon sent troops and cavalry into Galilee, and into the Great Plain, to destroy all Jonathan’s men. They perceived that he had been seized and had perished, along with those who were with him. They encouraged one another and went on their way close together, prepared to fight. Those who followed them saw that they were ready to fight for their lives, and turned back again. They all came in peace into the land of Judah, and they mourned for Jonathan and those who were with him, and they were very afraid. All Israel mourned with a great mourning. And all the Gentiles who were around them sought to destroy them utterly; for they said, “They have no ruler nor anyone to help them. Now therefore let’s fight against them, and take away their memory from among men.”

### Chapter 13

Simon heard that Tryphon had gathered together a mighty army to come into the land of Judah and destroy it utterly. He saw that the people were trembling in great fear. So he went up to Jerusalem and gathered the people together. He encouraged them, and said to them, “You yourselves know all the things that I, my kindred, and my father’s house have done for the laws and the sanctuary, and the battles and the distresses which we have seen. Because of this, all my brothers have perished for Israel’s sake, and I am left alone. Now be it far from me, that I should spare my own life in any time of affliction, for I am not better than my kindred. However, I will take vengeance for my nation, for the sanctuary, and for our wives and children, because all the Gentiles have gathered out of hatred to destroy us.”

The spirit of the people revived as soon as they heard these words. They answered with a loud voice, saying, “You are our leader in the place of Judas and Jonathan your brothers. Fight our battles, and we will do all that you tell us to do.”

He gathered together all the men of war, and hurried to finish the walls of Jerusalem. He fortified it all around. He sent Jonathan the son of Absalom, and with him a great army, to Joppa. He threw out those who were in it, and lived there.

Tryphon left Ptolemais with a mighty army to enter into the land of Judah, and Jonathan was with him under guard. But Simon encamped at Adida, near the plain. Tryphon knew that Simon had risen up in the place of his brother Jonathan, and meant to join battle with him, so he sent ambassadors to him, saying, “It is for money which Jonathan your brother owed to the king’s treasury, by reason of the offices which he had, that we are detaining him. Now send one hundred talents of silver and two of his sons for hostages, so that when he is released he may not revolt against us, and we will release him.”

Simon knew that they spoke to him deceitfully, but he sent to get the money and the children, lest perhaps he would arouse great hostility among the people, who might say, “Because I didn’t send him the money and the children, he perished.” So he sent the children and the hundred talents, but Tryphon lied, and didn’t release Jonathan.

After this, Tryphon came to invade the land and destroy it, and he went around by the way that leads to Adora. Simon and his army marched near him to every place, wherever he went. Now the people of the citadel sent to Tryphon ambassadors, urging him to come to them through the wilderness, and to send them food. So Tryphon prepared all his cavalry to come, but on that night a very heavy snow fell, and he didn’t come because of the snow. He marched off and went into the land of Gilead. When he came near to Bascama, he killed Jonathan, and he was buried there. Then Tryphon turned back, and went away into his own land.

Simon sent, and took the bones of Jonathan his brother, and buried him at Modin, the city of his fathers. All Israel made great lamentation over him, and mourned for him many days. Simon built a monument on the tomb of his father and his kindred, and raised it high so that it could be seen, with polished stone on the front and back. He also set up seven pyramids, one near another, for his father, his mother, and his four brothers. For these, he made an elaborate setting, erecting great pillars around them, and upon the pillars he made suits of armor for a perpetual memorial, and beside the suits of armor, he carved ships, so that they could be seen by all who sail on the sea. This is the tomb which he made at Modin. It remains to this day.

Now Tryphon deceived the young King Antiochus and killed him, and reigned in his place. He put on himself the crown of Asia and brought a great calamity upon the land. Simon built up the strongholds of Judea, and walled them all around with high towers, great walls, gates, and bars; and he stored food in the strongholds. Simon chose men, and sent to King Demetrius with a request that he grant the country an immunity, because all that Tryphon did was to plunder. King Demetrius sent to him according to these words, and answered him, and wrote a letter to him, as follows:

“King Demetrius to Simon the high priest and friend of kings, and to the elders and nation of the Jews, greetings. The golden crown and the palm branch, which you sent, we have received. We are ready to make a steadfast peace with you, yes, and to write to our officers to release you from tribute. Whatever things we confirmed to you, they are confirmed. The strongholds, which you have built, let them be your own. As for any oversights and faults committed to this day, we forgive them, and the crown tax which you owed us. If there were any other tax collected in Jerusalem, let it be collected no longer. If any among you are qualified to be enrolled in our court, let them be enrolled, and let there be peace between us.”

In the one hundred seventieth year, the yoke of the Gentiles was taken away from Israel. The people began to write in their instruments and contracts, “In the first year of Simon, the great high priest and captain and leader of the Jews.”

In those days Simon encamped against Gazara, and surrounded it with troops. He made a seige engine, and brought it up to the city, and struck a tower, and captured it. Those who were in the engine leaped out into the city; and there was a great uproar in the city. The people of the city tore their clothes, and went up on the walls with their wives and children, and cried with a loud voice, asking Simon to give them his right hand. They said, “Don’t deal with us according to our wickednesses, but according to your mercy.” So Simon was reconciled to them, and didn’t fight against them; but he expelled them from the city and cleansed the houses where the idols were, and then entered into it with singing and giving praise. He removed all uncleanness out of it, and placed in it men who would keep the law, and made it stronger than it was before, and built a dwelling place for himself in it.

But the people of the citadel in Jerusalem were hindered from going out and from going into the country, and from buying and selling. So they were very hungry, and a great number of them perished from famine. Then they cried out to Simon, that he should give them his right hand; and he gave it to them; but he expelled them from there, and he cleansed the citadel from its pollutions. He entered into it on the twenty-third day of the second month, in the one hundred seventy-first year, with praise and palm branches, with harps, with cymbals, and with stringed instruments, with hymns, and with songs, because a great enemy had been destroyed out of Israel. Simon ordained that they should keep that day every year with gladness. He made the hill of the temple that was by the citadel stronger than before, and he lived there with his men. Simon saw that his son John was a man, so he made him leader of all his forces; and he lived in Gazara.

### Chapter 14

In the one hundred seventy-second year, King Demetrius gathered his forces together, and went into Media to get help, that he might fight against Tryphon. When Arsaces, the king of Persia and Media, heard that Demetrius had come into his borders, he sent one of his princes to take him alive. He went and struck the army of Demetrius, and seized him and brought him to Arsaces, who put him under guard.

The land had rest all the days of Simon. He sought the good of his nation. His authority and his honor was pleasing to them all his days. Amid all his honors, he took Joppa for a harbor, and made it an entrance for the islands of the sea. He enlarged the borders of his nation and took possession of the country. He gathered together a great number of captives, and took control of Gazara, Bethsura, and the citadel, and he removed its uncleannesses from it. There was no one who resisted him. They tilled their land in peace, and the land gave her increase, and the trees of the plains gave their fruit. The old men sat in the streets; they all conversed together about good things. The young men put on glorious and warlike apparel. He provided food for the cities and furnished them with means of defense, until the glory of his name was known to the end of the earth. He made peace in the land, and Israel rejoiced with great joy. Each man sat under his vine and his fig tree, and there was no one to make them afraid. No one was left in the land who fought against them. The kings were defeated in those days. He strengthened all those of his people who were humble. He searched out the law, and every lawless and wicked person he took away. He glorified the sanctuary, and added to the vessels of the temple.

It was heard at Rome that Jonathan was dead, and even in Sparta, and they were exceedingly grieved. But as soon as they heard that his brother Simon was made high priest in his place, and ruled the country and the cities in it, they wrote to him on brass tablets to renew with him the friendship and the alliance which they had confirmed with his brothers Judas and Jonathan. These were read before the congregation at Jerusalem.

This is the copy of the letters which the Spartans sent:

“The rulers and the city of the Spartans, to Simon the high priest, to the elders, the priests, and the rest of the people of the Jews, our kindred, greetings. The ambassadors who were sent to our people reported to us about your glory and honor. We were glad for their coming, and we registered the things that were spoken by them in the public records as follows: ‘Numenius son of Antiochus, and Antipater son of Jason, the Jews’ ambassadors, came to us to renew the friendship they had with us. It pleased the people to entertain the men honorably, and to put the copy of their words in the public records, to the end that the people of the Spartans might have a record of them. Moreover they wrote a copy of these things to Simon the high priest.’”

After this, Simon sent Numenius to Rome with a great shield of gold of weighing one thousand minas, in order to confirm the alliance with them.

But when the people heard these things, they said, “What thanks shall we give to Simon and his sons? For he and his brothers and the house of his father have made themselves strong, and have fought and chased away Israel’s enemies, and confirmed liberty to Israel.” So they wrote on tablets of brass, and set them on pillars on mount Zion. This is the copy of the writing:

“On the eighteenth day of Elul, in the one hundred seventy-second year, which is the third year of Simon the high priest, in Asaramel, in a great congregation of priests and people and princes of the nation, and of the elders of the country, it was proclaimed to us: ‘Since wars often occurred in the country, Simon the son of Mattathias, the son of the sons of Joarib, and his brothers, put themselves in jeopardy and withstood the enemies of their nation, that their sanctuary and the law might be established, and glorified their nation with great glory. Jonathan rallied the nation, became their high priest, and was gathered to his people. Their enemies planned to invade their country, that they might destroy their country utterly, and stretch out their hands against their sanctuary. Then Simon rose up and fought for his nation. He spent much of his own money to arm the valiant men of his nation and give them wages. He fortified the cities of Judea and Bethsura that lies on the borders of Judea, where the weapons of the enemies were had been stored, and there he placed a garrison of Jews. He fortified Joppa which is upon the sea, and Gazara which is upon the borders of Azotus, where the enemies used to live, and placed Jews there, and set in there all things necessary for their restoration. The people saw Simon’s faith, and the glory which he resolved to bring to his nation, and they made him their leader and high priest, because he had done all these things, and for the justice and the faith which he kept to his nation, and because he sought by all means to exalt his people. In his days, things prospered in his hands, so that the Gentiles were taken away out of their country, and they also who were in the city of David, those who were in Jerusalem, who had made themselves a citadel, out of which they used to go, and polluted everything around the sanctuary, and did great damage to its purity. He placed Jews in it and fortified it for the safety of the country and the city, and made high the walls of Jerusalem. King Demetrius confirmed to him the high priesthood according to these things, and made him one of his friends, and honored him with great honor; for he had heard that the Jews had been called by the Romans friends, allies, and kindred, and that they had met the ambassadors of Simon honorably; and that the Jews and the priests were well pleased that Simon should be their leader and high priest forever, until there should arise a faithful prophet; and that he should be governor over them, and should take charge of the sanctuary, to set them over their works, and over the country, and over the weapons, and over the strongholds; and that he should take charge of the sanctuary, and that he should be obeyed by all, and that all contracts in the country should be written in his name, and that he should be clothed in purple, and wear gold; and that it should not be lawful for any of the people or of the priests to nullify any of these things, or to oppose the words that he should speak, or to gather an assembly in the country without him, or to be clothed in purple, or wear a buckle of gold; but whoever should do otherwise, or nullify any of these things, he will be liable to punishment.’” All the people consented to ordain for Simon that he should do according to these words. So Simon accepted this, and consented to be high priest, and to be captain and governor of the Jews and of the priests, and to be protector of all.

They commanded to put this writing on tablets of brass, and to set them up within the precinct of the sanctuary in a conspicuous place, and moreover to put copies of them in the treasury, so that Simon and his sons might have them.

### Chapter 15

Antiochus son of Demetrius the king sent a letter from the islands of the sea to Simon the priest and governor of the Jews, and to all the nation. Its contents follow:

“King Antiochus to Simon the chief priest and governor, and to the nation of the Jews, greetings. Whereas certain troublemakers have made themselves masters of the kingdom of our fathers, but my purpose is to claim the kingdom, that I may restore it as it was before; and moreover I have raised a multitude of foreign soldiers, and have prepared warships; moreover I plan to land in the country, that I may punish those who have destroyed our country, and those who have made many cities in the kingdom desolate; now therefore I confirm to you all the tax remissions which the kings who were before me remitted to you, and whatever gifts besides they remitted to you, and I permit you to coin money for your country with your own stamp, but that Jerusalem and the sanctuary should be free. All the weapons that you have prepared, and the strongholds that you have built, which you have in your possession, let them remain yours. Every debt owed to the king, and the things that will be owed to the king from henceforth and for evermore, let them be remitted to you. Moreover, when we have established our kingdom, we will glorify you and your nation and the temple with great glory, so that your glory will be made manifest in all the earth.

In the one hundred seventy-fourth year, Antiochus went into the land of his fathers; and all the forces came together to him, so that there were few men with Tryphon. King Antiochus pursued him, and he came, as he fled, to Dor, which is by the sea; for he knew that troubles had come upon him all at once, and that his forces had deserted him. Antiochus encamped against Dor, and with him one hundred twenty thousand men of war and eight thousand cavalry. He surrounded the city, and the ships joined in the attack from the sea. He harassed the city by land and sea, and permitted no one to go out or in.

Numenius and his company came from Rome, having letters to the kings and to the countries, in which were written these things:

“Lucius, consul of the Romans, to King Ptolemy, greetings. The Jews’ ambassadors came to us as our friends and allies, to renew the old friendship and alliance, being sent from Simon the high priest, and from the people of the Jews. Moreover they brought a shield of gold weighing one thousand minas. It pleased us therefore to write to the kings and to the countries, that they should not seek their harm or fight against them, their cities, and their country, or be allies with those who fight against them. Moreover, it seemed good to us to receive the shield from them. If therefore any troublemakers have fled from their country to you, deliver them to Simon the high priest, that he may take vengeance on them according to their law.”

He wrote the same things to King Demetrius, to Attalus, to Arathes, to Arsaces, to all the countries, to Sampsames, to the Spartans, to Delos, to Myndos, to Sicyon, to Caria, to Samos, to Pamphylia, to Lycia, to Halicarnassus, to Rhodes, to Phaselis, to Cos, to Side, to Aradus, Gortyna, Cnidus, Cyprus, and Cyrene. They also wrote this copy to Simon the high priest.

But King Antiochus encamped against Dor the second day, bringing his forces up to it continually, and making engines of war; and he shut up Tryphon from going in or out. Simon sent him two thousand chosen men to fight on his side, with silver, gold, and instruments of war in abundance. He would not receive them, but nullified all the covenants which he had made with him before, and was estranged from him. He sent to him Athenobius, one of his friends, to confer with him, saying, “You hold possession of Joppa, Gazara, and the citadel that is in Jerusalem, cities of my kingdom. You have devastated their territory, and done great harm in the land, and control of many places in my kingdom. Now therefore hand over the cities which you have taken, and the tributes of the places which you have taken control of outside of the borders of Judea; or else give me for them five hundred talents of silver; and for the harm that you have done, and the tributes of the cities, another five hundred talents. Otherwise we will come and subdue you.”

Athenobius, the king’s friend, came to Jerusalem. When he saw the glory of Simon, the cupboard of gold and silver vessels, and his great attendance, he was amazed. He reported to him the king’s words. Simon answered, and said to him, “We have not taken other men’s land nor do we have possession of that which belongs to others, but of the inheritance of our fathers. However, it had been in possession of our enemies wrongfully for a while. But we, having opportunity, firmly hold the inheritance of our fathers. As for Joppa and Gazara, which you demand, they did great harm among the people throughout our country. We will give one hundred talents for them.”

Athenobius didn’t answer even one word, but returned in a rage to the king, and reported to him these words, and the glory of Simon, and all that he had seen; and the king was exceedingly angry. Meanwhile, Tryphon embarked on board a ship, and fled to Orthosia.

The king appointed Cendebaeus chief captain of the sea coast, and gave him troops of infantry and cavalry. He commanded him to encamp against Judea, and he commanded him to build up Kidron, and to fortify the gates, and that he should fight against the people; but the king pursued Tryphon. So Cendebaeus came to Jamnia and began to provoke the people, and to invade Judea, and to take the people captive and kill them. He built Kidron and stationed cavalry and infantry there, to the end that going out they might make raids on the highways of Judea, as the king had commanded him.

### Chapter 16

John went up from Gazara and told Simon his father what Cendebaeus was doing. Simon called his two oldest sons, Judas and John, and said to them, “I and my brothers and my father’s house have fought the battles of Israel from our youth, even to this day; and things have prospered in our hands, that we have often delivered Israel. But now I am old, and you moreover, by his mercy, are of a sufficient age. Take the place of me and my brother, and go out and fight for our nation; and let the help which is from heaven be with you.

He chose out of the country twenty thousand men of war and cavalry, and they went against Cendebaeus, and slept at Modin. Rising up in the morning, they went into the plain, and, behold, a great army of infantry and cavalry came to meet them. There was a brook between them. He encamped near them, he and his people. He saw that the people were afraid to pass over the brook, and he passed over first. When the men saw him, they passed over after him. He divided the people, and placed the calvary in the midst of the infantry; but the enemies’ cavalry were exceedingly many. They sounded the trumpets; and Cendebaeus and his army were put to flight, and many of them fell wounded to death, but those who were left fled to the stronghold. At that time Judas, John’s brother, was wounded; but John pursued after them until he came to Kidron, which Cendebaeus had built. They fled to the towers that are in the fields of Azotus; and he burned it with fire. About two thousand men men of them fell. Then he returned into Judea in peace.

Ptolemy the son of Abubus had been appointed governor over the plain of Jericho, and he had much silver and gold; for he was the high priest’s son-in-law. His heart was lifted up, and he planned to make himself master of the country, and he made deceitful plans against Simon and his sons, to do away with them. Now Simon was visiting the cities that were in the country, and attending to their needs. He went down to Jericho—himself with Mattathias and Judas his sons—in the one hundred seventy-seventh year, in the eleventh month, which is the month Sebat. The son of Abubus received them deceitfully into the little stronghold that is called Dok, which he had built, and made them a great banquet, and hid men there. When Simon and his sons had drunk freely, Ptolemy and his men rose up, took their weapons, rushed in against Simon in the banqueting place, and killed him, his two sons, and some of his servants. He committed a great iniquity, and repaid evil for good.

Ptolemy wrote these things and sent to the king, that he should send him forces to aid him, and should deliver him their country and the cities. He sent others to Gazara to do away with John. To the captains of thousands, he sent letters to come to him, that he might give them silver, gold, and gifts. He sent others to take possession of Jerusalem and the temple hill. One ran before to Gazara, and told John that his father and kindred had perished, and he has sent to kill you also. When he heard, he was greatly shocked. He seized the men who came to destroy him and killed them; for he perceived that they were seeking to destroy him.

And the rest of the acts of John and of his wars and of his valiant deeds which he did, and of the building of the walls which he built, and of his achievements, behold, they are written in the chronicles of his high priesthood, from the time that he was made high priest after his father.

## 2 Maccabees

The Second Book of the Maccabees is recognized as Deuterocanonical Scripture by the Roman Catholic, Greek Orthodox, and Russian Orthodox Churches.

### Chapter 1

The kindred, the Jews who are in Jerusalem and those who are in the country of Judea, send greetings and good peace to the kindred, the Jews who are throughout Egypt. May God do good to you, and remember his covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, his faithful servants, and give you all a heart to worship him and do his will with a strong heart and a willing soul. May God open your heart to his law and his statutes, and make peace, and listen to your requests, and be reconciled with you, and not forsake you in an evil time. Now we are praying for you here.

In the reign of Demetrius, in the one hundred sixty-ninth year, we the Jews have already written to you in the suffering and in the distress that has come upon us in these years, from the time that Jason and his company revolted from the holy land and the kingdom, and set the gate on fire, and shed innocent blood. We prayed to the Lord, and were heard. We offered sacrifices and meal offerings. We lit the lamps. We set out the show bread. Now see that you keep the days of the feast of tabernacles in the month Chislev in the one hundred eighty-eighth year.

The people of Jerusalem and those who are in Judea, with the senate and Judas, to Aristobulus, King Ptolemy’s teacher, who is also of the stock of the anointed priests, and to the Jews who are in Egypt, we send greetings and health.

Having been saved by God out of great perils, as men arrayed against a king, we thank him greatly. For he threw out into Persia those who fought against us in the holy city. For when the prince had come there, with an army that seemed irresistible, they were cut to pieces in the temple of Nanaea by the treachery of Nanaea’s priests. For Antiochus, on the pretense that he would marry her, came into the place, he and his friends who were with him, that they might take a large part of the treasures as a dowry. And when the priests of Nanaea’s temple had set the treasures out, and he had come there with a small company within the wall of the sacred precinct, they locked the temple when Antiochus had come in. Opening the secret door of the panelled ceiling, they threw stones and struck down the prince. They cut him and his company in pieces, and cut off their heads, and threw them to the people who were outside. Blessed be our God in all things, who handed over those who had committed impiety.

Since we are now about to celebrate the purification of the temple in the month Chislev, on the twenty-fifth day, we thought it necessary to notify you, so that you may also keep a feast of tabernacles, and remember the fire which was given when Nehemiah offered sacrifices, after he had built both the temple and the altar.

For indeed when our fathers were about to be led into the land of Persia, the godly priests of that time took some of the fire of the altar, and hid it secretly in the hollow of a well that was without water, where they made sure that the place was unknown to anyone. Now after many years, when it pleased God, Nehemiah, having received a charge from the king of Persia, sent in quest of the fire the descendants of the priests who hid it. When they declared to us that they had found no fire, but thick liquid, he commanded them to draw some of it out and bring it to him. When the sacrifices had been offered, Nehemiah commanded the priests to sprinkle with that liquid both the wood and the things laid on it. When that was done and some time had passed, and the sun shone out, which before was hidden with clouds, a great blaze was kindled, so that all men marveled. The priests made a prayer while the sacrifice was being consumed—both the priests and all the others. Jonathan led and the rest responded, as Nehemiah did.

The prayer was like this: “O Lord, Lord God, the Creator of all things, who are awesome, strong, righteous, and merciful, who alone are King and gracious, who alone supply every need, who alone are righteous, almighty, and eternal, you who save Israel out of all evil, who chose the ancestors and sanctified them, accept the sacrifice for all your people Israel, and preserve your own portion, and consecrate it. Gather together our scattered people, set at liberty those who are in bondage among the heathen, look upon those who are despised and abhorred, and let the heathen know that you are our God. Punish those who oppress us and in arrogance shamefully entreat us. Plant your people in your holy place, even as Moses said.”

Then the priests sang the hymns. As soon as the sacrifice was consumed, then Nehemiah commanded that the rest of the liquid be poured on large stones. When this was done, a flame was kindled; but when the light from the altar shone back, it went out. When the matter became known, and it was told the king of the Persians that, in the place where the priests who were led away had hid the fire, the liquid appeared which Nehemiah and those who were with him purified the sacrifice, then the king enclosed the place and made it sacred after he had investigated the matter. When the king would show favor to any, he would exchange many presents and give them some of this liquid. Nehemiah and those who were with him called this thing “Nephthar”, which is by interpretation, “Cleansing”; but most men call it Nephthai.

### Chapter 2

It is also found in the records that Jeremiah the prophet commanded those who were carried away to take some of the fire, as has been mentioned, and how that the prophet charged those who were carried away, having given them the law, that they should not forget the statutes of the Lord or be led astray in their minds when they saw images of gold and silver, and their adornment. With other such words exhorted he them, that the law should not depart from their hearts.

It was in the writing that the prophet, being warned by God, commanded that the tabernacle and the ark should follow with him, when he went out to the mountain where Moses had gone up and saw God’s inheritance. Jeremiah came and found a cave, he brought the tabernacle, the ark, and the altar of incense into it; then he sealed the entrance. Some of those who followed with him came there that they might mark the way, and could not find it. But when Jeremiah learned about that, he rebuked them, saying, “The place shall be unknown until God gathers the people together again and shows mercy. Then the Lord will disclose these things, and the glory of the Lord shall be seen with the cloud, as it was also shown to Moses, also as Solomon implored that the place might be consecrated greatly, and it was also declared that he, having wisdom, offered a sacrifice of dedication, and of the finishing of the temple. As Moses prayed to the Lord and fire came down out of heaven and consumed the sacrifice, even so Solomon also prayed, and the fire came down and consumed the burnt offerings. Moses said, ‘Because the sin offering had not been eaten, it was consumed in like manner.’ Likewise Solomon kept the eight days.”

The same things were reported both in the public archives and in Nehemiah’s records, and also how he, founding a library, gathered together the books about the kings and prophets, and the writings of David, and letters of kings about sacred gifts. In like manner Judas also gathered together for us all those books that had been scattered by reason of the war, and they are still with us. If therefore you have need of them, send some people to bring them to you.

Seeing then that we are about to celebrate the purification, we write to you. You will therefore do well if you celebrate the days. Now God, who saved all his people, and restored the heritage to all, with the kingdom, the priesthood, and the consecration, even as he promised through the law—in God have we hope, that he will soon have mercy upon us, and gather us together out of everywhere under heaven into his holy place; for he delivered us out of great evils, and purified the place.

———————

Now the things concerning Judas Maccabaeus and his brothers, the purification of the greatest temple, the dedication of the altar, and further the wars against Antiochus Epiphanes and Eupator his son, and the manifestations that came from heaven to those who fought with one another in brave deeds for the religion of the Jews; so that, being but a few, they seized the whole country, chased the barbarous multitudes, recovered again the temple renowned all the world over, freed the city, and restored the laws which were about to be overthrown, seeing the Lord became gracious to them with all kindness. These things which have been declared by Jason of Cyrene in five books, we will attempt to abridge in one book. For having in view the confused mass of the numbers, and the difficulty which awaits those who would enter into the narratives of the history, by reason of the abundance of the matter, we were careful that those who choose to read may be attracted, and that those who wish us well may find it easy to recall, and that all readers may benefit. Although to us, who have taken upon ourselves the painful labor of the abridgement, the task is not easy, but a matter of sweat and sleeplessness, even as it is no light thing to him who prepares a banquet, and seeks the benefit of others. Nevertheless, for the sake of the gratitude of the many we will gladly endure the painful labor, leaving to the historian the exact handling of every particular, and again having no strength to fill in the outlines of our abridgement. For as the masterbuilder of a new house must care for the whole structure, and again he who undertakes to decorate and paint it must seek out the things fit for its adorning; even so I think it is also with us. To occupy the ground, and to indulge in long discussions, and to be curious in particulars, is fitting for the first author of the history; but to strive after brevity of expression, and to avoid a labored fullness in the treatment, is to be granted to him who would bring a writing into a new form. Here then let’s begin the narration, only adding this much to that which has already been said; for it is a foolish thing to make a long prologue to the history, and to abridge the history itself.

### Chapter 3

When the holy city was inhabited with unbroken peace and the laws were kept very well because of the godliness of Onias the high priest and his hatred of wickedness, it came to pass that even the kings themselves honored the place and glorified the temple with the noblest presents, so that even King Seleucus of Asia bore all the costs belonging to the services of the sacrifices out of his own revenues. But a man named Simon of the tribe of Benjamin, having been made guardian of the temple, disagreed with the high priest about the ruling of the market in the city. When he couldn’t overcome Onias, he went to Apollonius of Tarsus, who at that time was governor of Coelesyria and Phoenicia. He brought him word how that the treasury in Jerusalem was full of untold sums of money, so that the multitude of the funds was innumerable, and that they didn’t pertain to the account of the sacrifices, but that it was possible that these should fall under the king’s power. When Apollonius met the king, he informed him of the money about which he had been told. So the king appointed Heliodorus, who was his chancellor, and sent him with a command to accomplish the removal of the reported money. So Heliodorus set out on his journey at once, ostensibly to visit the cities of Coelesyria and Phoenicia, but in fact to execute the king’s purpose.

When he had come to Jerusalem and had been courteously received by the high priest of the city, he told him about the information which had been given, and declared why he had come; and he inquired if in truth these things were so. The high priest explained to him that there were in the treasury deposits of widows and orphans, and moreover some money belonging to Hyrcanus the son of Tobias, a man in very high place, not as that impious Simon falsely alleged; and that in all there were four hundred talents of silver and two hundred of gold, and that it was altogether impossible that wrong should be done to those who had put trust in the holiness of the place, and in the majesty and inviolable sanctity of the temple, honored over all the world. But Heliodorus, because of the king’s command given him, said that in any case this money must be confiscated for the king’s treasury.

So having appointed a day, he entered in to direct the inquiry concerning these matters; and there was no small distress throughout the whole city. The priests, prostrating themselves before the altar in their priestly garments, and called toward heaven upon him who gave the law concerning deposits, that he should preserve these treasures safe for those who had deposited them. Whoever saw the appearance of the high priest was wounded in mind; for his countenance and the change of his color betrayed the distress of his soul. For a terror and a shuddering of the body had come over the man, by which the pain that was in his heart was plainly shown to those who looked at him. Those who were in the houses rushed out in crowds to make a universal supplication, because the place was about to come into dishonor. The women, girded with sackcloth under their breasts, thronged the streets. The virgins who were kept indoors ran together, some to the gates, others to the walls, and some looked out through the windows. All, stretching out their hands toward heaven, made their solemn supplication. Then it was pitiful to see the multitude prostrating themselves all mixed together, and the anxiety of the high priest in his great distress.

While therefore they called upon the Almighty Lord to keep the things entrusted to them safe and secure for those who had entrusted them, Heliodorus went on to execute that which had been decreed. But when he was already present there with his guards near the treasury, the Sovereign of spirits and of all authority caused a great manifestation, so that all who had presumed to come with him, stricken with dismay at the power of God, fainted in terror. For they saw a horse with a frightening rider, adorned with beautiful trappings, and he rushed fiercely and struck at Heliodorus with his forefeet. It seemed like he who sat on the horse had complete armor of gold. Two others also appeared to him, young men notable in their strength, and beautiful in their glory, and splendid in their apparel, who stood by him on either side, and scourged him unceasingly, inflicting on him many sore stripes. When he had fallen suddenly to the ground, and great darkness had come over him, his guards picked him up and put him on a stretcher, and carried him—this man who had just now entered with a great retinue and all his guard into the aforesaid treasury, himself now brought to utter helplessness, manifestly made to recognize the sovereignty of God. So, while he, through the working of God, speechless and bereft of all hope and deliverance, lay prostrate, they blessed the Lord who acted marvelously for his own place. The temple, which a little before was full of terror and alarm, was filled with joy and gladness after the Almighty Lord appeared.

But quickly some of Heliodorus’s familiar friends implored Onias to call upon the Most High to grant life to him who lay quite at the last gasp. The high priest, secretly fearing lest the king might come to think that some treachery toward Heliodorus had been perpetrated by the Jews, brought a sacrifice for the recovery of the man. But as the high priest was making the atoning sacrifice, the same young men appeared again to Heliodorus, arrayed in the same garments. They stood and said, “Give Onias the high priest great thanks, for for his sake the Lord has granted you life. See that you, since you have been scourged from heaven, proclaim to all men the sovereign majesty of God.” When they had spoken these words, they vanished out of sight. So Heliodorus, having offered a sacrifice to the Lord and vowed great vows to him who had saved his life, and having bidden Onias farewell, returned with his army to the king. He testified to all men the works of the greatest God, which he had seen with his eyes.

When the king asked Heliodorus what sort of man was fit to be sent yet once again to Jerusalem, he said, “If you have any enemy or conspirator against the state, send him there, and you will receive him back well scourged, if he even escapes with his life; because truly there is some power of God in that place. For he who has his dwelling in heaven himself has his eyes on that place and helps it. Those who come to hurt it, he strikes and destroys.”

This was the history of Heliodorus and the keeping of the treasury.

### Chapter 4

The previously mentioned Simon, who had given information about the money against his country, slandered Onias, saying that it was he who had incited Heliodorus and had been the real cause of these evils. He dared to call him a conspirator against the state who was actually the benefactor of the city, the guardian of his fellow countrymen, and a zealot for the laws. When his hatred grew so great that even murders were perpetrated through one of Simon’s approved agents, Onias, seeing the danger of the contention, and that Apollonius the son of Menestheus, the governor of Coelesyria and Phoenicia, was increasing Simon’s malice, appealed to the king, not to be an accuser of his fellow-citizens, but looking to the good of all the people, both public and private; for he saw that without the king’s involvement it was impossible for the state to obtain peace any more, and that Simon would not cease from his madness.

When Seleucus was deceased, and Antiochus, who was called Epiphanes, succeeded to the kingdom, Jason the brother of Onias supplanted his brother in the high priesthood, having promised to the king at an audience three hundred sixty talents of silver, and out of another fund eighty talents. In addition to this, he undertook to assign one hundred fifty more, if it might be allowed him through the king’s authority to set him up a gymnasium and a body of youths to be trained in it, and to register the inhabitants of Jerusalem as citizens of Antioch. When the king had assented, and Jason had taken possession of the office, he immediately shifted those of his own race to the Greek way of life. Setting aside the royal ordinances of special favor to the Jews, granted by the means of John the father of Eupolemus, who went on the mission to the Romans to establish friendship and alliance, and seeking to overthrow the lawful ways of living, he brought in new customs forbidden by the law. For he eagerly established a gymnasium under the citadel itself, and caused the noblest of the young men to wear the Greek hat. Thus there was an extreme of hellenization, and an advance of a foreign religion, by reason of the exceeding profaneness of Jason, who was an ungodly man and not a high priest; so that the priests had no more any zeal for the services of the altar; but despising the sanctuary and neglecting the sacrifices, they hastened to enjoy that which was unlawfully provided in the wrestling arena, after the summons to the discus-throwing. They despised the honors of their fathers, and valued the prestige of the Greeks best of all. For this reason, severe calamity overtook them. The men whose ways of living they earnestly followed, and to whom they desired to be made like in all things, these became their enemies and punished them. For it is not a light thing to show irreverence to God’s laws, but later events will make this clear.

Now when certain games that came every fifth year were kept at Tyre, and the king was present, the vile Jason sent sacred envoys, as being Antiochians of Jerusalem, bearing three hundred drachmas of silver to the sacrifice of Hercules, which even the bearers thereof thought not right to use for any sacrifice, because it was not fit, but to spend it for another purpose. Although the intended purpose of the sender this money was for the sacrifice of Hercules, yet on account of present circumstances it went to the construction of trireme warships.

Now when Apollonius the son of Menestheus was sent into Egypt for the enthronement of Philometor as king, Antiochus, learning that Philometor had shown himself hostile toward the government, took precautions for the security of his realm. Therefore, going to Joppa, he travelled on to Jerusalem. Being magnificently received by Jason and the city, he was brought in with torches and shouting. Then he led his army down into Phoenicia.

Now after a space of three years, Jason sent Menelaus, the previously mentioned Simon’s brother, to carry the money to the king, and to make reports concerning some necessary matters. But he being commended to the king, and having been glorified by the display of his authority, secured the high priesthood for himself, outbidding Jason by three hundred talents of silver. After receiving the royal mandates, he returned bringing nothing worthy of the high priesthood, but having the passion of a cruel tyrant and the rage of a savage animal. So Jason, who had supplanted his own brother, was supplanted by another and driven as a fugitive into the country of the Ammonites, Menelaus had possession of the office; but of the money that had been promised to the king nothing was regularly paid, even though Sostratus the governor of the citadel demanded it— for his job was the gathering of the revenues—so they were both called by the king to his presence. Menelaus left his own brother Lysimachus for his deputy in the high priesthood; and Sostratus left Crates, who was over the Cyprians.

Now while this was the state of things, it came to pass that the people of Tarsus and Mallus revolted because they were to be given as a present to Antiochis, the king’s concubine. The king therefore quickly came to settle matters, leaving for his deputy Andronicus, a man of high rank. Then Menelaus, supposing that he had gotten a favorable opportunity, presented to Andronicus certain vessels of gold belonging to the temple, which he had stolen. He had already sold others into Tyre and the neighboring cities. When Onias had sure knowledge of this, he sharply reproved him, having withdrawn himself into a sanctuary at Daphne, that lies by Antioch. Therefore Menelaus, taking Andronicus aside, asked him to kill Onias. Coming to Onias, and being persuaded to use treachery, and being received as a friend, Andronicus gave him his right hand with oaths and, though he was suspicious, persuaded him to come out of the sanctuary. Then, with no regard for justice, he immediately put him to death. For this reason not only Jews, but many also of the other nations, had indignation and displeasure at the unjust murder of the man. And when the king had come back from the places in Cilicia, the Jews who were in the city appealed to him against Andronicus (the Greeks also joining with them in hatred of the wickedness), urging that Onias had been wrongfully slain. Antiochus therefore was heartily sorry, and was moved to pity, and wept, because of the sober and well ordered life of him who was dead. Being inflamed with anger, he immediately stripped off Andronicus’s purple robe, and tore off his under garments, and when he had led him round through the whole city to that very place where he had committed the outrage against Onias, there he put the murderer out of the way, the Lord rendering to him the punishment he had deserved.

Now when many sacrileges had been committed in the city by Lysimachus with the consent of Menelaus, and when the report of them had spread abroad outside, the people gathered themselves together against Lysimachus, after many vessels of gold had already been stolen. When the multitudes were rising against him and were filled with anger, Lysimachus armed about three thousand men, and with unrighteous violence began the attack under the leadership of Hauran, a man far gone in years and no less also in folly. But when they perceived the assault of Lysimachus, some caught up stones, others logs of wood, and some took handfuls of the ashes that lay near, and they flung them all in wild confusion at Lysimachus and those who were with him. As a result, they wounded many of them, they killed some, and they forced the rest of them to flee, but the author of the sacrilege himself they killed beside the treasury.

But about these matters, there was an accusation laid against Menelaus. When the king had come to Tyre, the three men who were sent by the senate pleaded the cause before him. But Menelaus, seeing himself now defeated, promised much money to Ptolemy the son of Dorymenes, that he might win over the king. Therefore Ptolemy taking the king aside into a cloister, as if to get some fresh air, convinced him to change his mind. He who was the cause of all the evil, Menelaus, he discharged from the accusations; but these hapless men, who, if they had pleaded even before Scythians, would have been discharged uncondemned, them he sentenced to death. Those who were spokesmen for the city and the families of Israel and the holy vessels soon suffered that unrighteous penalty. Therefore even certain Tyrians, moved with hatred of the wickedness, provided magnificently for their burial. But Menelaus, through the covetous dealings of those who were in power, remained still in his office, growing in wickedness, established as a great conspirator against his fellow-citizens.

### Chapter 5

Now about this time Antiochus made his second invasion into Egypt. It happened that throughout all the city, for almost forty days, cavalry appeared in the midst of the sky in swift motion, wearing robes woven with gold and carrying spears, equipped with troops for battle— drawing swords, squadrons of cavalry in array, encounters and pursuits of both armies, shaking shields, multitudes of lances, throwing of missiles, flashing of golden trappings, and putting on all sorts of armor. Therefore everyone prayed that the manifestation might have been given for good.

When a false rumor had arisen that Antiochus was dead, Jason took not less than a thousand men, and suddenly made an assault upon the city. When those who were on the wall were being routed, and the city was at length nearly taken, Menelaus took refuge in the citadel. But Jason slaughtered his own citizens without mercy, not considering that good success against kinsmen is the greatest misfortune, but supposing himself to be setting up trophies over enemies, and not over fellow-countrymen. He didn’t win control of the government, but receiving shame as the result of his conspiracy, he fled again as a fugitive into the country of the Ammonites. At last therefore he met with a miserable end. Having been imprisoned at the court of Aretas the prince of the Arabians, fleeing from city to city, pursued by all men, hated as an rebel against the laws, and abhorred as the executioner of his country and his fellow citizens, he was cast ashore in Egypt. He who had driven many from their own country into exile perished in exile, having crossed the sea to the Lacedaemonians, hoping to find shelter there because they were near of kin. He who had thrown out a multitude unburied had none to mourn for him. He didn’t have any funeral at all and no place in the tomb of his ancestors.

Now when news came to the king concerning that which was done, he thought that Judea was in revolt. So, setting out from Egypt in a rage, he took the city by force of weapons, and commanded his soldiers to cut down without mercy those who came in their way, and to kill those who went into their houses. Then there was killing of young and old, destruction of boys, women, and children, and slaying of virgins and infants. In a total of three days, eighty thousand were destroyed, of which forty thousand were slain in close combat, and no fewer were sold into slavery than slain.

Not content with this, he presumed to enter into the most holy temple of all the earth, having Menelaus for his guide (who had proved himself a traitor both to the laws and to his country), even taking the sacred vessels with his polluted hands, and dragging down with his profane hands the offerings that had been dedicated by other kings to enhance the glory and honor of the place. Antiochus was lifted up in mind, not seeing that because of the sins of those who lived in the city the Sovereign Lord had been provoked to anger a little while, and therefore his eye was turned away from the place. But had it not been so that they were already bound by many sins, this man, even as Heliodorus who was sent by King Seleucus to view the treasury, would, as soon as he came forward, have been scourged and turned back from his daring deed. However the Lord didn’t choose the nation for the place’s sake, but the place for the nation’s sake. Therefore also the place itself, having shared in the calamities that happened to the nation, did afterward share in its benefits; and the place which was forsaken in the wrath of the Almighty was, at the reconciliation of the great Sovereign, restored again with all glory.

As for Antiochus, when he had carried away out of the temple one thousand eight hundred talents, he hurried away to Antioch, thinking in his arrogance that he could sail on land and walk on the sea, because his heart was lifted up. Moreover he left governors to afflict the race: at Jerusalem, Philip, by race a Phrygian, and in character more barbarous than him who set him there; and at Gerizim, Andronicus; and besides these, Menelaus, who worse than all the rest, exalted himself against his fellow-citizens. Having a malicious mind toward the Jews whom he had made his citizens, he sent that lord of pollutions Apollonius with an army of twenty-two thousand, commanding him to kill all those who were of full age, and to sell the women and the boys as slaves. He came to Jerusalem, and pretending to be a man of peace, waited till the holy day of the Sabbath, and finding the Jews at rest from work, he commanded his men to parade fully armed. He put to the sword all those who came out to the spectacle. Running into the city with the armed men, he killed great multitudes. But Judas, who is also called Maccabaeus, with about nine others, withdrew himself, and with his company kept himself alive in the mountains like wild animals do. They continued feeding on what grew wild, that they might not be partakers of the defilement.

### Chapter 6

Not long after this, the king sent out an old man of Athens to compel the Jews to depart from the laws of their fathers and not to live by the laws of God, and also to pollute the sanctuary in Jerusalem and to call it by the name of Olympian Zeus, and to call the sanctuary in Gerizim by the name of Zeus the Protector of foreigners, even as the people who lived in that place did.

The visitation of this evil was harsh and utterly grievous. For the temple was filled with debauchery and reveling by the heathen, who dallied with prostitutes, and had intercourse with women within the sacred precincts, and moreover brought inside things that were not appropriate. The altar was filled with those abominable things which had been prohibited by the laws. A man could neither keep the Sabbath, nor observe the feasts of their ancestors, nor so much as confess himself to be a Jew.

On the day of the king’s birth every month, they were led along with bitter constraint to eat of the sacrifices. When the feast of Dionysia came, they were compelled to go in procession in honor of Dionysus, wearing wreaths of ivy. A decree went out to the neighboring Greek cities, by the suggestion of Ptolemy, that they should observe the same conduct against the Jews, and should make them eat of the sacrifices, and that they should kill those who didn’t choose to go over to the Greek rites. So the present misery was for all to see. For example, two women were brought in for having circumcised their children. These, when they had led them publicly around the city with the babes hung from their breasts, they threw down headlong from the wall. Others who had run together into the caves nearby to keep the seventh day secretly, were betrayed to Philip and were all burned together, because their piety kept them from defending themselves, in view of the honor of that most solemn day.

I urge those who read this book to not be discouraged because of the calamities, but recognize that these punishments were not for the destruction, but for the chastening of our race. For indeed it is a sign of great kindness that those who act impiously are not let alone for a long time, but immediately meet with retribution. For in the case of the other nations, the Sovereign Lord waits patiently to punish them until they have attained to the full measure of their sins; but not with us, that he may not take vengeance on us afterward, when we have come to the height of our sins. Therefore he never withdraws his mercy from us; but though he chastens with calamity, he doesn’t forsake his own people. However let this that we have spoken suffice to remind you; but after a few words, we must come to the narrative.

Eleazar, one of the principal scribes, a man already well advanced in years, and of a noble countenance, was compelled to open his mouth to eat swine’s flesh. But he, welcoming death with honor rather than life with defilement, advanced of his own accord to the instrument of torture, but first spat out the flesh, as men ought to come who are resolute to repel such things as not even for the natural love of life is it lawful to taste.

But those who had the charge of that forbidden sacrificial feast took the man aside, for the acquaintance which of old times they had with him, and privately implored him to bring flesh of his own providing, such as was proper for him to use, and to make as if he did eat of the flesh from the sacrifice, as had been commanded by the king; that by so doing he might be delivered from death, and so his ancient friendship with them might be treated kindly. But he, having formed a high resolve, and one that became his years, the dignity of old age, and the gray hairs which he had reached with honor, and his excellent education from a child, or rather the holy laws of God’s ordaining, declared his mind accordingly, bidding them to quickly send him to Hades.

“For it doesn’t become our years to dissemble,” he said, “that many of the young should suppose that Eleazar, the man of ninety years, had gone over to an alien religion; and so they, by reason of my deception, and for the sake of this brief and momentary life, would be led astray because of me, and I defile and disgrace myself in my old age. For even if for the present time I would remove from me the punishment of men, yet whether I live or die, I wouldn’t escape the hands of the Almighty. Therefore, by bravely parting with my life now, I will show myself worthy of my old age, and leave behind a noble example to the young to die willingly and nobly a glorious death for the revered and holy laws.”

When he had said these words, he went immediately to the instrument of torture. When they changed the good will they bore toward him a little before into ill will because these words of his were, as they thought, sheer madness, and when he was at the point to die with the blows, he groaned aloud and said, “To the Lord, who has the holy knowledge, it is manifest that, while I might have been delivered from death, I endure severe pains in my body by being scourged; but in soul I gladly suffer these things because of my fear of him.”

So this man also died like this, leaving his death for an example of nobleness and a memorial of virtue, not only to the young but also to the great body of his nation.

### Chapter 7

It came to pass that seven brothers and their mother were at the king’s command taken and shamefully handled with scourges and cords, to compel them to taste of the abominable swine’s flesh. One of them made himself the spokesman and said, “What would you ask and learn from us? For we are ready to die rather than transgress the laws of our ancestors.”

The king fell into a rage, and commanded that pans and caldrons be heated. When these were immediately heated, he gave orders to cut out the tongue of him who had been their spokesman, and to scalp him, and to cut off his extremities, with the rest of his brothers and his mother looking on. And when he was utterly maimed, the king gave orders to bring him to the fire, being yet alive, and to fry him in the pan. And as the smoke from the pan spread far, they and their mother also exhorted one another to die nobly, saying this: “The Lord God sees, and in truth is entreated for us, as Moses declared in his song, which witnesses against the people to their faces, saying, ‘And he will have compassion on his servants.’”

And when the first had died like this, they brought the second to the mocking; and they pulled off the skin of his head with the hair and asked him, “Will you eat, before your body is punished in every limb?”

But he answered in the language of his ancestors and said to them, “No.” Therefore he also underwent the next torture in succession, as the first had done. When he was at the last gasp, he said, “You, miscreant, release us out of this present life, but the King of the world will raise us who have died for his laws up to an everlasting renewal of life.”

After him, the third was made a victim of their mocking. When he was required, he quickly put out his tongue, and stretched out his hands courageously, and nobly said, “I got these from heaven. For his laws’ sake I treat these with contempt. From him, I hope to receive these back again.” As a result, the king himself and those who were with him were astonished at the young man’s soul, for he regarded the pains as nothing.

When he too was dead, they shamefully handled and tortured the fourth in the same way. Being near to death he said this: “It is good to die at the hands of men and look for the hope which is given by God, that we will be raised up again by him. For as for you, you will have no resurrection to life.”

Next after him, they brought the fifth and shamefully handled him. But he looked toward the king and said, “Because you have authority among men, though you are corruptible, you do what you please. But don’t think that our race has been forsaken by God. But hold on to your ways, and see how his sovereign majesty will torture you and your descendants!”

After him they brought the sixth. When he was about to die, he said, “Don’t be vainly deceived, for we suffer these things for our own doings, as sinning against our own God. Astounding things have come to pass; but don’t think you that you will be unpunished, having tried to fight against God!”

But above all, the mother was marvelous and worthy of honorable memory; for when she watched seven sons perishing within the space of one day, she bore the sight with a good courage because of her hope in the Lord. She exhorted each one of them in the language of their fathers, filled with a noble spirit and stirring up her woman’s thoughts with manly courage, saying to them, “I don’t know how you came into my womb. It wasn’t I who gave you your spirit and your life. It wasn’t I who brought into order the first elements of each one of you. Therefore the Creator of the world, who shaped the first origin of man and devised the first origin of all things, in mercy gives back to you again both your spirit and your life, as you now treat yourselves with contempt for his laws’ sake.”

But Antiochus, thinking himself to be despised, and suspecting the reproachful voice, while the youngest was yet alive didn’t only make his appeal to him by words, but also at the same time promised with oaths that he would enrich him and raise him to high honor if he would turn from the ways of his ancestors, and that he would take him for his friend and entrust him with public affairs. But when the young man would in no way listen, the king called to him his mother, and urged her to advise the youth to save himself. When he had urged her with many words, she undertook to persuade her son. But bending toward him, laughing the cruel tyrant to scorn, she spoke this in the language of her fathers: “My son, have pity upon me who carried you nine months in my womb, and nursed you three years, and nourished and brought you up to this age, and sustained you. I beg you, my child, to lift your eyes to the sky and the earth, and to see all things that are in it, and thus to recognize that God made them not of things that were, and that the race of men in this way comes into being. Don’t be afraid of this butcher, but, proving yourself worthy of your brothers, accept your death, that in God’s mercy I may receive you again with your brothers.”

But before she had finished speaking, the young man said, “What are you all waiting for? I don’t obey the commandment of the king, but I listen to the commandment of the law that was given to our fathers through Moses. But you, who have devised all kinds of evil against the Hebrews, will in no way escape God’s hands. For we are suffering because of our own sins. If for rebuke and chastening, our living Lord has been angered a little while, yet he will again be reconciled with his own servants. But you, O unholy man and of all most vile, don’t be vainly lifted up in your wild pride with uncertain hopes, raising your hand against the heavenly children. For you have not yet escaped the judgment of the Almighty God who sees all things. For these our brothers, having endured a short pain that brings everlasting life, have now died under God’s covenant. But you, through God’s judgment, will receive in just measure the penalties of your arrogance. But I, as my brothers, give up both body and soul for the laws of our fathers, calling upon God that he may speedily become gracious to the nation, and that you, amidst trials and plagues, may confess that he alone is God, and that in me and my brothers you may bring to an end the wrath of the Almighty which has been justly brought upon our whole race.”

But the king, falling into a rage, handled him worse than all the rest, being exasperated at his mocking. So he also died pure, putting his whole trust in the Lord.

Last of all, after her sons, the mother died.

Let it then suffice to have said thus much concerning the sacrificial feasts and the extreme tortures.

### Chapter 8

But Judas, who is also called Maccabaeus, and those who were with him, making their way secretly into the villages, called to them their kindred. Taking to them those who had continued in the Jews’ religion, gathered together about six thousand. They called upon the Lord to look at the people who were oppressed by all, and to have compassion on the sanctuary that had been profaned by the ungodly men, and to have pity on the city that was suffering ruin and ready to be leveled to the ground, and to listen to the blood that cried out to him, and to remember the lawless destruction of the innocent infants, and concerning the blasphemies that had been committed against his name, and to show his hatred of wickedness.

When Maccabaeus had trained his men for service, the heathen at once found him irresistible, for the wrath of the Lord was turned into mercy. Coming without warning, he set fire to cities and villages. And in winning back the most important positions, putting to flight no small number of the enemies, he especially took advantage of the nights for such assaults. His courage was loudly talked of everywhere.

But when Philip saw the man gaining ground little by little, and increasing more and more in his success, he wrote to Ptolemy, the governor of Coelesyria and Phoenicia, that he should support the king’s cause. Ptolemy quickly appointed Nicanor the son of Patroclus, one of the king’s chief friends, and sent him, in command of no fewer than twenty thousand of all nations, to destroy the whole race of Judea. With him he joined Gorgias also, a captain and one who had experience in matters of war. Nicanor resolved by the sale of the captive Jews to make up for the king the tribute of two thousand talents which he was to pay to the Romans. Immediately he sent to the cities upon the sea coast, inviting them to buy Jewish slaves, promising to deliver seventy slaves for a talent, not expecting the judgment that was to overtake him from the Almighty.

News came to Judas concerning Nicanor’s invasion. When he communicated to those who were with him the presence of the army, those who were cowardly and distrustful of God’s judgment ran away and left the country. Others sold all that they had left, and at the same time implored the Lord to deliver those who had been sold as slaves by the impious Nicanor before he ever met them, if not for their own sakes, then for the covenants made with their ancestors, and because he had called them by his holy and glorious name. So Maccabaeus gathered his men together, six thousand in number, and exhorted them not to be frightened by the enemy, nor to fear the great multitude of the heathen who came wrongfully against them, but to fight nobly, setting before their eyes the outrage that had been lawlessly perpetrated upon the holy place, and the torture of the city that had been turned to mockery, and further the overthrow of the way of life received from their ancestors. “For they,” he said, “trust their weapons and daring deeds, but we trust in the almighty God, since he is able at a nod to cast down those who are coming against us, and even the whole world.” Moreover, he recounted to them the help given from time to time in the days of their ancestors, both in the days of Sennacherib, when one hundred eighty-five thousand perished, and in the land of Babylon, in the battle that was fought against the Gauls, how they came to the battle with eight thousand in all, with four thousand Macedonians, and how, the Macedonians being hard pressed, the six thousand destroyed the hundred and twenty thousand because of the help which they had from heaven, and took a great deal of plunder.

And when he had with these words filled them with courage and made them ready to die for the laws and their country, he divided his army into four parts. He appointed his brothers, Simon, Joseph, and Jonathan, to be leaders of the divisions with him, giving each the command of one thousand five hundred men. Moreover Eleazer also, having read aloud the sacred book, and having given as watchword, “THE HELP OF GOD”, leading the first band himself, joined battle with Nicanor.

Since the Almighty fought on their side, they killed more than nine thousand of the enemy, and wounded and disabled most of Nicanor’s army, and compelled them all to flee. They took the money of those who had come there to buy them as slaves. After they had pursued them for some distance, they returned, being constrained by the time of the day; for it was the day before the Sabbath, and for this reason they made no effort to chase them far. When they had gathered the weapons of the enemy together, and had stripped off their spoils, they kept the Sabbath, greatly blessing and thanking the Lord who had saved them to this day, because he had begun to show mercy to them. After the Sabbath, when they had given some of the spoils to the maimed, and to the widows and orphans, they distributed the rest among themselves and their children. When they had accomplished these things and had made a common supplication, they implored the merciful Lord to be wholly reconciled with his servants.

Having had an encounter with the forces of Timotheus and Bacchides, they killed more than twenty thousand of them, and made themselves masters of exceedingly high strongholds, and divided very much plunder, giving the maimed, orphans, widows, and the aged an equal share with themselves. When they had gathered the weapons of the enemy together, they stored them all up carefully in the most strategic positions, and they carried the rest of the spoils to Jerusalem. They killed the phylarch of Timotheus’s forces, a most unholy man, and one who had done the Jews much harm. As they celebrated the feast of victory in the city of their fathers, they burned those who had set the sacred gates on fire, including Callisthenes, who had fled into a little house. So they received the proper reward for their impiety.

The thrice-accursed Nicanor, who had brought the thousand merchants to buy the Jews as slaves, being through the help of the Lord humbled by them who in his eyes were held to be of least account, took off his glorious apparel, and passing through the country, shunning all company like a fugitive slave, arrived at Antioch, having, as he thought, had the greatest possible good fortune, though his army was destroyed. He who had taken upon himself to make tribute sure for the Romans by the captivity of the men of Jerusalem published abroad that the Jews had One who fought for them, and that because this was so, the Jews were invulnerable, because they followed the laws ordained by him.

### Chapter 9

Now about that time, Antiochus retreated in disorder from the region of Persia. For he had entered into the city called Persepolis, and he attempted to rob a temple and to control the city. Therefore the multitudes rushed in and the people of the country turned to defend themselves with weapons; and it came to pass that Antiochus was put to flight by the people of the country and broke his camp with disgrace. While he was at Ecbatana, news was brought to him about what had happened to Nicanor and the forces of Timotheus. Being overcome by his anger, he planned to make the Jews suffer for the evil deeds of those who had put him to flight. Therefore, with judgment from heaven even now accompanying him, he ordered his charioteer to drive without ceasing until he completed the journey; for he arrogantly said this: “I will make Jerusalem a common graveyard of Jews when I come there.”

But the All-seeing Lord, the God of Israel, struck him with a fatal and invisible stroke. As soon as he had finished speaking this word, an incurable pain of the bowels seized him, with bitter torments of the inner parts— and that most justly, for he had tormented other men’s bowels with many and strange sufferings. But he in no way ceased from his rude insolence. No, he was filled with even more arrogance, breathing fire in his passion against the Jews, and giving orders to hasten the journey. But it came to pass moreover that he fell from his chariot as it rushed along, and having a grievous fall was tortured in all of the members of his body. He who had just supposed himself to have the waves of the sea at his bidding because he was so superhumanly arrogant, and who thought to weigh the heights of the mountains in a balance, was now brought to the ground and carried in a litter, showing to all that the power was obviously God’s, so that worms swarmed out of the impious man’s body, and while he was still living in anguish and pains, his flesh fell off, and by reason of the stench all the army turned with loathing from his decay. The man who a little before supposed himself to touch the stars of heaven, no one could endure to carry because of his intolerable stench. Therefore he began in great part to cease from his arrogance, being broken in spirit, and to come to knowledge under the scourge of God, his pains increasing every moment. When he himself could not stand his own smell, he said these words: “It is right to be subject to God, and that one who is mortal should not think they are equal to God.”

The vile man vowed to the sovereign Lord, who now no more would have pity upon him, saying that the holy city, to which he was going in haste to lay it even with the ground and to make it a common graveyard, he would declare free. Concerning the Jews, whom he had decided not even to count worthy of burial, but to cast them out to the animals with their infants for the birds to devour, he would make them all equal to citizens of Athens. The holy sanctuary, which before he had plundered, he would adorn with best offerings, and would restore all the sacred vessels many times multiplied, and out of his own revenues would defray the charges that were required for the sacrifices. Beside all this, he said that he would become a Jew and would visit every inhabited place, proclaiming the power of God. But when his sufferings did in no way cease, for the judgment of God had come upon him in righteousness, having given up all hope for himself, he wrote to the Jews the letter written below, having the nature of a supplication, to this effect:

“To the worthy Jewish citizens, Antiochus, king and general, wishes much joy and health and prosperity. May you and your children fare well, and may your affairs be as you wish. Having my hope in heaven, I remembered with affection your honor and good will. Returning out of the region of Persia, and being taken with an annoying sickness, I deemed it necessary to take thought for the common safety of all, not despairing of myself, but having great hope to escape from the sickness. But considering that my father also, at the time he led an army into the upper country, appointed his successor, to the end that, if anything fell out contrary to expectation, or if any unwelcome tidings were brought, the people in the country, knowing to whom the state had been left, might not be troubled, and, moreover, observing how the princes who are along the borders and neighbors to my kingdom watch for opportunities and look for the future event, I have appointed my son Antiochus to be king, whom I often entrusted and commended to most of you when I was hurrying to the upper provinces. I have written to him what is written below. I therefore urge you and beg you, having in your remembrance the benefits done to you in common and severally, to preserve your present good will, each of you, toward me and my son. For I am persuaded that he in gentleness and kindness will follow my purpose and treat you with moderation and kindness.

So the murderer and blasphemer, having endured the most intense sufferings, even as he had dealt with other men, ended his life among the mountains by a most piteous fate in a strange land. Philip his foster brother took the body home and then, fearing the son of Antiochus, he withdrew himself to Ptolemy Philometor in Egypt.

### Chapter 10

Then Maccabaeus and those who were with him, the Lord leading them on, recovered the temple and the city. They pulled down the altars that had been built in the marketplace by the foreigners, and also the sacred enclosures. Having cleansed the sanctuary, they made another altar of sacrifice. Striking flint and starting a fire, they offered sacrifices after they had ceased for two years, burned incense, lit lamps, and set out the show bread. When they had done these things, they fell prostrate and implored the Lord that they might fall no more into such evils; but that, if they ever did sin, they might be chastened by him with forbearance, and not be delivered to blaspheming and barbarous heathen. Now on the same day that the sanctuary was profaned by foreigners, upon that very day it came to pass that the sanctuary was cleansed, even on the twenty-fifth day of the same month, which is Chislev. They observed eight days with gladness in the manner of the feast of tabernacles, remembering how not long before, during the feast of tabernacles, they were wandering in the mountains and in the caves like wild animals. Therefore carrying wands wreathed with leaves, and beautiful branches, and palm fronds also, they offered up hymns of thanksgiving to him who had successfully brought to pass the cleansing of his own place. They ordained also with a public statute and decree, for all the nation of the Jews, that they should observe these days every year.

Such were the events of the end of Antiochus, who was called Epiphanes.

Now we will declare what came to pass under Antiochus Eupator, who proved himself a son of that ungodly man, and will summarize the main evils of the wars. For this man, when he succeeded to the kingdom, appointed one Lysias to be chancellor and supreme governor of Coelesyria and Phoenicia. For Ptolemy who was called Macron, setting an example of observing justice toward the Jews because of the wrong that had been done to them, endeavored to deal with them on peaceful terms. Whereupon being accused by the king’s friends before Eupator, and hearing himself called traitor at every turn because he had abandoned Cyprus which Philometor had entrusted to him, and had withdrawn himself to Antiochus Epiphanes, and failing to uphold the honor of his office, he took poison and did away with himself.

But when Gorgias was made governor of the district, he maintained a force of mercenaries, and at every turn kept up war with the Jews. Together with him the Idumaeans also, being masters of important strongholds, harassed the Jews; and received those who had taken refuge from Jerusalem, they endeavored to keep up the war. But Maccabaeus and his men, having made solemn supplication and having implored God to fight on their side, rushed upon the strongholds of the Idumaeans. Assaulting them vigorously, they took control of the positions, and kept off all who fought upon the wall, and killed those whom they encountered, killing no fewer than twenty thousand.

Because no fewer than nine thousand had fled into two very strong towers having everything needed for a seige, Maccabaeus, having left Simon and Joseph, and also Zacchaeus and those who were with him, a force sufficient to besiege them, departed himself to places where he was most needed. But Simon and those who were with him, yielding to covetousness, were bribed by some of those who were in the towers, and receiving seventy thousand drachmas, let some of them slip away. But when word was brought to Maccabaeus of what was done, he gathered the leaders of the people together, and accused those men of having sold their kindred for money by setting their enemies free to fight against them. So he killed these men for having turned traitors, and immediately took possession of the two towers. Prospering with his weapons in everything he undertook, he destroyed more than twenty thousand in the two strongholds.

Now Timotheus, who had been defeated by the Jews before, having gathered together foreign forces in great multitudes, and having collected the cavalry which belonged to Asia, not a few, came as though he would take Judea by force of weapons. But as he drew near, Maccabaeus and his men sprinkled dirt on their heads and girded their loins with sackcloth, in supplication to God, and falling down upon the step in front of the altar, implored him to become gracious to them, and be an enemy to their enemies and an adversary to their adversaries, as the law declares. Rising from their prayer they took up their weapons, and advanced some distance from the city. When they had come near to their enemies, they halted. When the dawn was now breaking, the two armies joined in battle, the one part having this, beside virtue, for a pledge of success and victory, that they had fled to the Lord for refuge, the others making their passion their leader in the fight.

When the battle became strong, there appeared out of heaven to their adversaries five splendid men on horses with bridles of gold, and two of them, leading on the Jews, and taking Maccabaeus in the midst of them, and covering him with their own armor, guarded him from wounds, while they shot arrows and thunderbolts at the enemies. For this reason, they were blinded and thrown into confusion, and were cut to pieces, filled with bewilderment. Twenty thousand five hundred were slain, beside six hundred cavalry.

Timotheus himself fled into a stronghold called Gazara, a fortress of great strength, where Chaereas was in command. Then Maccabaeus and his men were glad and laid siege to the fortress for four days. Those who were within, trusting in the strength of the place, blasphemed exceedingly, and hurled out impious words. But at dawn of the fifth day, certain young men of Maccabaeus’ company, inflamed with anger because of the blasphemies, assaulted the wall with masculine force and with furious anger, and cut down whoever came in their way. Others climbing up in the same way, while the enemies were distracted with those who had made their way within, set fire to the towers, and kindled fires that burned the blasphemers alive, while others broke open the gates, and, having given entrance to the rest of the band, occupied the city. They killed Timotheus, who was hidden in a cistern, and his brother Chaereas, and Apollophanes. When they had accomplished these things, they blessed the Lord with hymns and thanksgiving, blessing him who provides great benefits to Israel and gives them the victory.

### Chapter 11

Now after a very little time, Lysias, the king’s guardian, kinsman, and chancellor, being very displeased about the things that had happened, collected about eighty thousand infantry and all his cavalry and came against the Jews, planing to make the city a home for Greeks, and to levy tribute on the temple, as on the other sacred places of the nations, and to put up the high priesthood for sale every year. He took no account of God’s power, but was puffed up with his ten thousands of infantry, his thousands of cavalry, and his eighty elephants. Coming into Judea and approaching Bethsuron, which was a strong place and about five stadia away from Jerusalem, he pressed it hard.

When Maccabaeus and his men learned that he was besieging the strongholds, they and all the people with lamentations and tears made supplication to the Lord to send a good angel to save Israel. Maccabaeus himself took up weapons first, and exhorted the others to put themselves in jeopardy together with him and help their kindred; and they went out with him very willingly. As they were there, close to Jerusalem, a horseman appeared at their head in white apparel, brandishing weapons of gold. They all together praised the merciful God, and were yet more strengthened in heart, being ready to assail not only men but the wildest animals and walls of iron, they advanced in array, having him who is in heaven to fight on their side, for the Lord had mercy on them. Hurling themselves like lions against the enemy, they killed eleven thousand infantry and one thousand six hundred cavalry, and forced all the rest to flee. Most of them escaped wounded and naked. Lysias himself also escaped by shameful flight. But as he was a man not void of understanding, pondering the defeat which had befallen him, and considering that the Hebrews could not be overcome because the Almighty God fought on their side, he sent again and persuaded them to come to terms on condition that all their rights were acknowledged, and promised that he would also persuade the king to become their friend. Maccabaeus gave consent upon all the conditions which Lysias proposed to him, being careful of the common good; for whatever requests Maccabaeus delivered in writing to Lysias concerning the Jews the king allowed.

The letter written to the Jews from Lysias was to this effect:

“Lysias to the people of the Jews, greetings. John and Absalom, who were sent from you, having delivered the document written below, made request concerning the things written therein. Whatever things therefore needed to be brought before the king I declared to him, and what things were possible he allowed. If then you will all preserve your good will toward the government, I will also endeavor in the future to contribute to your good. Concerning this, I have given order in detail, both to these men and to those who are sent from me, to confer with you. Farewell. Written in the one hundred forty-eighth year, on the twenty-fourth day of the month Dioscorinthius.”

And the king’s letter contained these words:

“King Antiochus to his brother Lysias, greetings. Seeing that our father passed to the gods having the wish that the subjects of his kingdom should be undisturbed and give themselves to the care of their own affairs, we, having heard that the Jews do not consent to our father’s purpose to turn them to the customs of the Greeks, but choose rather their own way of living, and make request that the customs of their law be allowed to them— choosing therefore that this nation also should be free from disturbance, we determine that their temple is to be restored to them, and that they live according to the customs that were in the days of their ancestors. You will therefore do well to send messengers to them and give them the right hand of friendship, that they, knowing our mind, may be of good heart, and gladly occupy themselves with the conduct of their own affairs.”

And to the nation, the king’s letter was as follows:

“King Antiochus to the senate of the Jews and to the other Jews, greetings. If you are all well, it is as we desire. We ourselves also are in good health. Menelaus informed us that your desire was to return home and follow your own business. They therefore who depart home up to the thirtieth day of Xanthicus shall have our friendship, with full permission that the Jews use their own foods and observe their own laws, even as formerly. None of them shall be in any way molested for the things that have been done in ignorance. Moreover I have sent Menelaus also, that he may encourage you. Farewell. Written in the one hundred forty-eighth year, on the fifteenth day of Xanthicus.”

The Romans also sent to them a letter in these words:

“Quintus Memmius and Titus Manius, ambassadors of the Romans, to the people of the Jews, greetings. In regard to the things which Lysias the king’s kinsman granted you, we also give consent. But as for the things which he judged should be referred to the king, send someone promptly, after you have considered them, that we may publish such decrees as are appropriate for your case; for we are on our way to Antioch. Therefore send someone with speed, that we also may learn what is your mind. Farewell. Written in the one hundred forty-eighth year, on the fifteenth day of Xanthicus.

### Chapter 12

So when this agreement had been made, Lysias departed to the king, and the Jews went about their farming.

But some of the governors of districts, Timotheus and Apollonius the son of Gennaeus, and also Hieronymus and Demophon, and beside them Nicanor the governor of Cyprus, would not allow them to enjoy tranquillity and live in peace. Men of Joppa perpetrated this great impiety: they invited the Jews who lived among them to go with their wives and children into the boats which they had provided, as though they had no ill will toward them. When the Jews, relying on the public vote of the city, accepted the invitation, as men desiring to live in peace and suspecting nothing, they took them out to sea and drowned not less than two hundred of them. When Judas heard of the cruelty done to his fellow-countrymen, giving command to the men that were with him and calling upon God the righteous Judge, he came against the murderers of his kindred, and set the harbor on fire at night, burned the boats, and put to the sword those who had fled there. But when the town gates were closed, he withdrew, intending to come again to root out the whole community of the men of Joppa. But learning that the men of Jamnia intended to do the same thing to the Jews who lived among them, he attacked the Jamnites at night, and set fire to the harbor together with the fleet, so that the glare of the light was seen at Jerusalem, two hundred forty furlongs distant.

Now when they had drawn off nine furlongs from there, as they marched against Timotheus, an army of Arabians attacked him, no fewer than five thousand infantry and five hundred cavalry. And when a hard battle had been fought, and Judas and his company, by the help of God, had good success, the nomads being overcome implored Judas to grant them friendship, promising to give him livestock, and to help his people in all other ways. So Judas, thinking that they would indeed be profitable in many things, agreed to live in peace with them; and receiving pledges of friendship they departed to their tents.

He also attacked a certain city, strong and fenced with earthworks and walls, and inhabited by a mixed multitude of various nations. It was named Caspin. Those who were within, trusting in the strength of the walls and their store of provisions, behaved themselves rudely toward Judas and those who were with him, railing, and furthermore blaspheming and speaking impious words. But Judas and his company, calling upon the great Sovereign of the world, who without rams and cunning engines of war hurled down Jericho in the times of Joshua, rushed wildly against the wall. Having taken the city by the will of God, they made unspeakable slaughter, so much that the adjoining lake, which was two furlongs broad, appeared to be filled with the deluge of blood.

When they had gone seven hundred fifty furlongs from there, they made their way to Charax, to the Jews that are called Tubieni. They didn’t find Timotheus in that district, for he had by then departed from the district without accomplishing anything, but had left behind a very strong garrison in one place. But Dositheus and Sosipater, who were captains under Maccabaeus, went out and destroyed those who had been left by Timotheus in the stronghold, more than ten thousand men. Maccabaeus, arranging his own army in divisions, set these two over the bands, and marched in haste against Timotheus, who had with him one hundred twenty thousand infantry and two thousand five hundred cavalry. When Timotheus heard of the approach of Judas, he at once sent away the women and the children with the baggage into the fortress called Carnion; for the place was hard to besiege and difficult of access by reason of the narrowness of the approaches on all sides. When the band of Judas, who led the first division, appeared in sight, and when terror and fear came upon the enemy, because the manifestation of him who sees all things came upon them, they fled in every direction, carried this way and that, so that they were often injured by their own men, and pierced with the points of their own swords. Judas continued the pursuit more vigorously, putting the wicked wretches to the sword, and he destroyed as many as thirty thousand men.

Timotheus himself, falling in with the company of Dositheus and Sosipater, implored them with much crafty guile to let him go with his life, because he had in his power the parents of many of them and the kindred of some. “Otherwise, he said, little regard will be shown to these.” So when he had with many words confirmed the agreement to restore them without harm, they let him go that they might save their kindred.

Then Judas, marching against Carnion and the temple of Atergatis, killed twenty-five thousand people. After he had put these to flight and destroyed them, he marched against Ephron also, a strong city, wherein were multitudes of people of all nations. Stalwart young men placed on the walls made a vigorous defense. There were great stores of war engines and darts there. But calling upon the Sovereign who with might shatters the strength of the enemy, they took the city into their hands, and killed as many as twenty-five thousand of those who were in it.

Setting out from there, they marched in haste against Scythopolis, which is six hundred furlongs away from Jerusalem. But when the Jews who were settled there testified of the good will that the Scythopolitans had shown toward them, and of their kind treatment of them in the times of their misfortune, they gave thanks, and further exhorted them to remain well disposed toward the race for the future. Then they went up to Jerusalem, the feast of weeks being close at hand.

But after the feast called Pentecost, they marched in haste against Gorgias the governor of Idumaea. He came out with three thousand infantry and four hundred cavalry. When they had set themselves in array, it came to pass that a few of the Jews fell. A certain Dositheus, one of Bacenor’s company, who was on horseback and was a strong man, pressed hard on Gorgias, and taking hold of his cloke dragged him along by main force. While he planned to take the accursed man alive, one of the Thracian cavalry bore down on him and disabled his shoulder, and so Gorgias escaped to Marisa.

When those who were with Esdris had been fighting long and were weary, Judas called upon the Lord to show himself, fighting on their side and leading in the battle. Then in the language of his ancestors he raised the battle cry joined with hymns. Then he rushed against Gorgias’ troops when they were not expecting it, and put them to flight.

Judas gathered his army and came to the city of Adullam. As the seventh day was coming on, they purified themselves according to the custom, and kept the Sabbath there.

On the following day, when it had become necessary, Judas and his company came to take up the bodies of those who had fallen, and in company with their kinsmen to bring them back to the sepulchres of their ancestors. But under the garments of each one of the dead they found consecrated tokens of the idols of Jamnia, which the law forbids the Jews to have anything to do with. It became clear to all that it was for this cause that they had fallen. All therefore, blessing the ways of the Lord, the righteous Judge, who makes manifest the things that are hidden, turned themselves to supplication, praying that the sin committed might be wholly blotted out. The noble Judas exhorted the multitude to keep themselves from sin, for they had seen with their own eyes what happened because of the sin of those who had fallen. When he had made a collection man by man to the sum of two thousand drachmas of silver, he sent to Jerusalem to offer a sacrifice for sin, doing very well and honorably in this, in that he took thought for the resurrection. For if he wasn’t expecting that those who had fallen would rise again, it would be superfluous and idle to pray for the dead. But if he was looking forward to an honorable memorial of gratitude laid up for those who die in godliness, then the thought was holy and godly. Therefore he made the atoning sacrifice for those who had died, that they might be released from their sin.

### Chapter 13

In the one hundred forty-ninth year, news was brought to Judas and his company that Antiochus Eupator was coming with multitudes against Judea, and with him Lysias his guardian and chancellor, each having a Greek force of one hundred ten thousand infantry, five thousand three hundred cavalry, twenty-two elephants, and three hundred chariots armed with scythes.

And Menelaus also joined himself with them, and with great hypocrisy encouraged Antiochus, not for the saving of his country, but because he thought that he would be set over the government. But the King of kings stirred up the anger of Antiochus against the wicked wretch. When Lysias informed him that this man was the cause of all the evils, the king commanded to bring him to Beroea, and to put him to death in the way customary in that place. Now there is in that place a tower that is fifty cubits high, full of ashes, and it had all around it a circular rim sloping steeply on every side into the ashes. Here one who is guilty of sacrilege or notorious for other crimes is pushed down to destruction. By such a fate it happened that the breaker of the law, Menelaus, died, without obtaining so much as a grave in the earth, and that justly; for inasmuch as he had perpetrated many sins against the altar, whose fire and whose ashes were holy, he received his death in ashes.

Now the king, infuriated in spirit, was coming with intent to inflict on the Jews the very worst of the sufferings that had been done in his father’s time. But when Judas heard of these things, he commanded the multitude to call upon the Lord day and night, if ever at any other time, so now to help those who were at the point of being deprived of the law, their country, and the holy temple, and not to allow the people who had just begun to be revived to fall into the hands of those profane heathen. So when they had all done the same thing together, begging the merciful Lord with weeping and fastings and prostration for three days without ceasing, Judas exhorted them and commanded they should join him.

Having consulted privately with the elders, he resolved that before the king’s army entered into Judea and made themselves masters of the city, they should go out and decide the matter by the help of God. And committing the decision to the Lord of the world, and exhorting those who were with him to contend nobly even to death for laws, temple, city, country, and way of life, he pitched his camp by Modin. He gave out to his men the watchword, “VICTORY IS GOD’S”, with a chosen force of the bravest young men he attacked by the king’s pavilion by night, and killed of his army as many as two thousand men, and brought down the leading elephant with him who was in the tower on him. At last they filled the army with terror and alarm, and departed with good success. This had been accomplished when the day was just dawning, because of the Lord’s protection that gave Judas help.

But the king, having had a taste of the exceeding boldness of the Jews, made strategic attacks on their positions, and on a strong fortress of the Jews at Bethsura. He advanced, was turned back, failed, and was defeated. Judas sent the things that were necessary to those who were within. But Rhodocus, from the Jewish ranks, made secrets known to the enemy. He was sought out, arrested, and shut up in prison. The king negotiated with them in Bethsura the second time, gave his hand, took theirs, departed, attacked the forces of Judas, was put to the worse, heard that Philip who had been left as chancellor in Antioch had become reckless, was confounded, made to the Jews an overture of peace, submitted himself and swore to acknowledge all their rights, came to terms with them and offered sacrifice, honored the sanctuary and the place, showed kindness and graciously received Maccabaeus, left Hegemonides governor from Ptolemais even to the Gerrenians, and came to Ptolemais. The men of Ptolemais were displeased at the treaty, for they had exceedingly great indignation against the Jews. They desired to annul the articles of the agreement. Lysias came forward to speak, made the best defense that was possible, persuaded, pacified, gained their good will, and departed to Antioch. This was the issue of the attack and departure of the king.

### Chapter 14

Three years later, news was brought to Judas and his company that Demetrius the son of Seleucus, having sailed into the harbor of Tripolis with a mighty army and a fleet, had taken possession of the country, having made away with Antiochus and his guardian Lysias.

But one Alcimus, who had formerly been high priest, and had willfully polluted himself in the times when there was no mingling with the Gentiles, considering that there was no deliverance for him in any way, nor any more access to the holy altar, came to King Demetrius in about the one hundred fifty-first year, presenting to him a crown of gold and a palm, and beside these some of the festal olive boughs of the temple. For that day, he held his peace; but having gotten opportunity to further his own madness, being called by Demetrius into a meeting of his council, and asked how the Jews stood affected and what they intended, he answered:

“Those of the Jews called Hasidaeans, whose leader is Judas Maccabaeus, keep up war and are seditious, not allowing the kingdom to find tranquillity. Therefore, having laid aside my ancestral glory—I mean the high priesthood—I have now come here, first for the genuine care I have for the things that concern the king, and secondly because I have regard also to my own fellow citizens. For through the unadvised dealing of those of whom I spoke before, our whole race is in no small misfortune. O king, having informed yourself of these things, take thought both for our country and for our race, which is surrounded by enemies, according to the gracious kindness with which you receive all. For as long as Judas remains alive, it is impossible for the government to find peace. When he had spoken such words as these, at once the rest of the king’s friends, having ill will against Judas, inflamed Demetrius yet more. He immediately appointed Nicanor, who had been master of the elephants, and made him governor of Judea. He sent him out, giving him written instructions to kill Judas himself and to scatter those who were with him, and to set up Alcimus as high priest of the great temple. Those in Judea who had driven Judas into exile thronged to Nicanor in flocks, supposing that the misfortunes and calamities of the Jews would be successes to themselves.

But when the Jews heard of Nicanor’s advance and the assault of the heathen, they sprinkled dirt on their heads and made solemn prayers to him who had established his own people for evermore, and who always, making manifest his presence, upholds those who are his own heritage. When the leader had given orders, he immediately set out from there and joined battle with them at a village called Lessau. But Simon, the brother of Judas, had encountered Nicanor, yet not till late, having been delayed by reason of the sudden consternation caused by his adversaries.

Nevertheless Nicanor, hearing of the valor of those who were with Judas, and their courage in fighting for their country, shrank from bringing the matter to the decision of the sword. Therefore he sent Posidonius, Theodotus, and Mattathias to give and receive pledges of friendship. So when these proposals had been long considered, and the leader had made the troops acquainted with them, and it appeared that they were all of like mind, they consented to the covenants. They appointed a day on which to meet together by themselves. A chariot came forward from each army. They set up seats of honor. Judas stationed armed men ready in convenient places, lest perhaps there should suddenly be treachery on the part of the enemy. They held a conference as was appropriate. Nicanor waited in Jerusalem, and did nothing to cause disturbance, but dismissed the flocks of people that had gathered together. He kept Judas always in his presence. He had gained a hearty affection for the man. He urged him to marry and have children. He married, settled quietly, and took part in common life.

But Alcimus, perceiving the good will that was between them, and having taken possession of the covenants that had been made, came to Demetrius and told him that Nicanor was disloyal to the government, for he had appointed that conspirator against his kingdom, Judas, to be his successor. The king, falling into a rage, and being exasperated by the false accusations of that most wicked man, wrote to Nicanor, signifying that he was displeased at the covenants, and commanding him to send Maccabaeus prisoner to Antioch in all haste. When this message came to Nicanor, he was confounded, and was very troubled at the thought of annulling the articles that had been agreed upon, the man having done no wrong; but because there was no opposing the king, he watched his time to execute this purpose by strategy. But Maccabaeus, when he perceived that Nicanor was behaving more harshly in his dealings with him, and that he had become ruler in his customary bearing, understanding that this harshness came not of good, gathered together not a few of his men, and concealed himself from Nicanor.

But the other, when he became aware that he had been bravely defeated by the strategy of Judas, came to the great and holy temple, while the priests were offering the usual sacrifices, and commanded them to hand over the man. When they declared with oaths that they had no knowledge where the man was whom he sought, he stretched out his right hand toward the sanctuary, and swore this oath: “If you won’t deliver up to me Judas as a prisoner, I will level this temple of God even with the ground, break down the altar, and I will erect here a temple to Dionysus for all to see.

And having said this, he departed. But the priests, stretching forth their hands toward heaven, called upon him who always fights for our nation, in these words: “You, O Lord of the universe, who in yourself have need of nothing, were well pleased that a sanctuary of your habitation should be set among us. So now, O holy Lord of all holiness, keep undefiled forever this house that has been recently cleansed.”

Now information was given to Nicanor against one Razis, an elder of Jerusalem, who was a lover of his countrymen and a man of very good report, and one called Father of the Jews for his good will. For in the former times when there was no mingling with the Gentiles, he had been accused of following the Jews’ religion, and had risked body and life with all earnestness for the religion of the Jews. Nicanor, wishing to make evident the ill will that he bore against the Jews, sent above five hundred soldiers to seize him; for he thought by seizing him to inflict an injury on them. But when the troops were at the point of taking the tower, and were forcing the door of the court, and asked for fire to burn the doors, he, being surrounded on every side, fell upon his sword, choosing rather to die nobly than to fall into the hands of the wicked wretches, and suffer outrage unworthy of his own nobleness. But since he missed his stroke through the excitement of the struggle, and the crowds were now rushing within the door, he ran bravely up to the wall and cast himself down bravely among the crowds. But as they quickly gave back, a space was made, and he fell on the middle of his side. Still having breath within him, and being inflamed with anger, he rose up, and though his blood gushed out in streams and his wounds were grievous, he ran through the crowds, and standing upon a steep rock, when as his blood was now well near spent, he drew forth his bowels through the wound, and taking them in both his hands he shook them at the crowds. Calling upon him who is Lord of life and spirit to restore him these again, he died like this.

### Chapter 15

But Nicanor, hearing that Judas and his company were in the region of Samaria, resolved to attack them with complete safety on the day of rest. When the Jews who were compelled to follow him said, “Don’t destroy so savagely and barbarously, but give due glory to the day which he who sees all things has honored and hallowed above other days.”

Then the thrice-accursed wretch asked if there were a Sovereign in heaven who had commanded to keep the Sabbath day.

When they declared, “There is the Lord, living himself as Sovereign in heaven, who told us observe the seventh day.”

He replied, “I also am a sovereign on the earth, who commands you to take up weapons and execute the king’s business.” Nevertheless he didn’t prevail to execute his cruel plan.

And Nicanor, in his utter boastfulness and arrogance, had determined to set up a monument of complete victory over Judas and all those who were with him. But Maccabaeus still trusted unceasingly, with all hope that he should obtain help from the Lord. He exhorted his company not to be fearful at the assault of the heathen, but keeping in mind the help which in former times they had often received from heaven, so now also to look for the victory which would come to them from the Almighty, and encouraging them out of the law and the prophets, and reminding them of the conflicts that they had won, he made them more eager. And when he had aroused their courage, he gave them orders, at the same time pointing out the faithlessness of the heathen and their breach of their oaths. Arming each one of them, not so much with the sure defense of shields and spears as with the encouragement of good words, and moreover relating to them a dream worthy to be believed, he made them all exceedingly glad.

The vision of that dream was this: Onias, he who had been high priest, a noble and good man, modest in bearing, yet gentle in manner and well-spoken, and trained from a child in all points of virtue, with outstretched hands invoking blessings on the whole body of the Jews. Then he saw a man appear, of venerable age and exceeding glory, and the dignity around him was wonderful and most majestic. Onias answered and said, “This is the lover of the kindred, he who prays much for the people and the holy city: Jeremiah the prophet of God. Jeremiah stretched out his right hand and delivered to Judas a gold sword, and in giving it addressed him thus: “Take this holy sword, a gift from God, with which you shall strike down the adversaries.”

Being encouraged by the words of Judas, which were noble and effective, and able to incite to virtue and to stir the souls of the young to manly courage, they determined not to carry on a campaign, but nobly to bear down upon the enemy, and fighting hand to hand with all courage bring the matter to a conclusion, because the city, the sanctuary, and the temple were in danger. For their fear for wives and children, and furthermore for family and relatives, was less important to them; but greatest and first was their fear for the consecrated sanctuary. Also those who were shut up in the city were in no light distress, being troubled because of the encounter in the open country.

When all were now waiting for the decision of the issue, and the enemy had already joined battle, and the army had been set in array, and the elephants brought back to a convenient post, and the cavalry deployed on the flanks, Maccabaeus, perceiving the presence of the troops, and the various weapons with which they were equipped, and the savageness of the elephants, holding up his hands to heaven called upon the Lord who works wonders, knowing that success comes not by weapons, but that, according to how the Lord judges, he gains the victory for those who are worthy. And calling upon God, he said this: “You, O Sovereign Lord, sent your angel in the time of King Hezekiah of Judea, and he killed of the army of Sennacherib as many as one hundred eighty-five thousand. So now also, O Sovereign of the heavens, send a good angel before us to bring terror and trembling. Through the greatness of your arm let them be stricken with dismay who with blasphemy have come here against your holy people.” As he finished these words, Nicanor and his company advanced with trumpets and victory songs; but Judas and his company joined battle with the enemy with invocation and prayers. Fighting with their hands and praying to God with their hearts, they killed no less than thirty-five thousand men, being made exceedingly glad by the manifestation of God.

When the engagement was over and they were returning again with joy, they recognized Nicanor lying dead in full armor. Then there was shouting and noise, and they blessed the Sovereign Lord in the language of their ancestors. He who in all things was in body and soul the foremost champion of his fellow-citizens, he who kept through life the good will of his youth toward his countrymen, ordered that Nicanor’s head be cut off with his hand and arm, and that they be brought to Jerusalem. When he had arrived there and had called his countrymen together and set the priests before the altar, he sent for those who were in the citadel. Showing the head of the vile Nicanor and the hand of that profane man, which with proud brags he had stretched out against the holy house of the Almighty, and cutting out the tongue of the impious Nicanor, he said that he would give it in pieces to the birds, and hang up these rewards of his folly near the sanctuary. They all, looking up to heaven, blessed the Lord who had manifested himself, saying, “Blessed is he who has preserved his own place undefiled!” He hung Nicanor’s head and shoulder from the citadel, a clear sign evident to all of the help of the Lord. They all ordained with a common decree to in no way let this day pass undistinguished, but to mark with honor the thirteenth day of the twelfth month (it is called Adar in the Syrian language), the day before the day of Mordecai.

This then having been the account of the attempt of Nicanor, and the city having from those times been held by the Hebrews, I also will here make an end of my book. If I have written well and to the point in my story, this is what I myself desired; but if its poorly done and mediocre, this is the best I could do. For as it is distasteful to drink wine alone and likewise to drink water alone, while the mingling of wine with water at once gives full pleasantness to the flavor; so also the fashioning of the language delights the ears of those who read the story.

Here is the end.

## 1 Esdras

The First Book of Esdras is recognized as Deuterocanonical Scripture by the Greek Orthodox and Russian Orthodox Churches. It is not recognized by the Roman Catholic Church, but Esdras is placed as an appendix to the Latin Vulgate Bible.

### Chapter 1

Josias held the Passover in Jerusalem to his Lord, and offered the Passover the fourteenth day of the first month, having set the priests according to their daily courses, being arrayed in their vestments, in the Lord’s temple. He spoke to the Levites, the temple servants of Israel, that they should make themselves holy to the Lord, to set the holy ark of the Lord in the house that King Solomon the son of David had built. He said, “You no longer need to carry it on your shoulders. Now therefore serve the Lord your God, and minister to his people Israel, and prepare yourselves by your fathers’ houses and kindred, according to the writing of King David of Israel, and according to the magnificence of Solomon his son. Stand in the holy place according to the divisions of your Levite families who minister in the presence of your kindred the descendants of Israel. Offer the Passover in order, prepare the sacrifices for your kindred, and keep the Passover according to the Lord’s commandment, which was given to Moses.

To the people which were present, Josias gave thirty thousand lambs and kids, and three thousand calves. These things were given from the king’s possessions, as he promised, to the people and to the priests and Levites. Helkias, Zacharias, and Esyelus, the rulers of the temple, gave to the priests for the Passover two thousand six hundred sheep, and three hundred calves. Jeconias, Samaias, Nathanael his brother, Sabias, Ochielus, and Joram, captains over thousands, gave to the Levites for the Passover five thousand sheep and seven hundred calves.

When these things were done, the priests and Levites, having the unleavened bread, stood in proper order according to the kindred, and according to the several divisions by fathers’ houses, before the people, to offer to the Lord as it is written in the book of Moses. They did this in the morning. They roasted the Passover lamb with fire, as required. They boiled the sacrifices in the brazen vessels and caldrons with a pleasing smell, and set them before all the people. Afterward they prepared for themselves and for their kindred the priests, the sons of Aaron. For the priests offered the fat until night. The Levites prepared for themselves and for their kindred the priests, the sons of Aaron. The holy singers also, the sons of Asaph, were in their order, according to the appointment of David: Asaph, Zacharias, and Eddinus, who represented the king. Moreover the gatekeepers were at every gate. No one needed to depart from his daily duties, for their kindred the Levites prepared for them.

So the things that belonged to the Lord’s sacrifices were accomplished in that day, in holding the Passover, and offering sacrifices on the altar of the Lord, according to the commandment of King Josias. So the children of Israel which were present at that time held the Passover and the feast of unleavened bread seven days. Such a Passover had not been held in Israel since the time of the prophet Samuel. Indeed, none of the kings of Israel held such a Passover as Josias with the priests, the Levites, and the Jews, held with all Israel that were present in their dwelling place at Jerusalem. This Passover was held in the eighteenth year of the reign of Josias. The works of Josias were upright before his Lord with a heart full of godliness. Moreover the things that came to pass in his days have been written in times past, concerning those who sinned and did wickedly against the Lord more than any other people or kingdom, and how they grieved him exceedingly, so that the Lord’s words were confirmed against Israel.

Now after all these acts of Josias, it came to pass that Pharaoh the king of Egypt came to make war at Carchemish on the Euphrates; and Josias went out against him. But the king of Egypt sent to him, saying, “What do I have to do with you, O king of Judea? I wasn’t sent out from the Lord God against you, for my war is against the Euphrates. Now the Lord is with me, yes, the Lord is with me hastening me forward. Depart from me, and don’t be against the Lord.”

However, Josias didn’t turn back to his chariot, but tried to fight with him, not regarding the words of the prophet Jeremy from the Lord’s mouth, but joined battle with him in the plain of Megiddo, and the commanders came down against King Josias. Then the king said to his servants, “Carry me away out of the battle, for I am very weak!” Immediately his servants carried him away out of the army. Then he got into his second chariot. After he was brought back to Jerusalem he died, and was buried in the tomb of his ancestors. All Judea mourned for Josias. Jeremy the prophet lamented for Josias, and the chief men with the women made lamentation for him to this day. This was given out for an ordinance to be done continually in all the nation of Israel. These things are written in the book of the histories of the kings of Judea, and every one of the acts that Josias did, and his glory, and his understanding in the law of the Lord, and the things that he had done before, and the things now told, are reported in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah.

The people took Joachaz the son of Josias, and made him king instead of Josias his father, when he was twenty-three years old. He reigned in Judah and Jerusalem for three months. Then the king of Egypt deposed him from reigning in Jerusalem. He set a tax upon the people of one hundred talents of silver and one talent of gold. The king of Egypt also made King Joakim his brother king of Judea and Jerusalem. And Joakim imprisoned the nobles and apprehended his brother Zarakes, and brought him up out of Egypt.

Joakim was twenty-five years old when he began to reign in Judea and Jerusalem. He did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord. King Nabuchodonosor of Babylon came up against him, bound him with a chain of brass, and carried him to Babylon. Nabuchodonosor also took some of the Lord’s holy vessels, carried them away, and stored them in his own temple at Babylon. But those things that are reported of him, and of his uncleanness and impiety, are written in the chronicles of the kings. Then Joakim his son reigned in his place. When he was made king, he was eighteen years old. He reigned three months and ten days in Jerusalem. He did that which was evil before the Lord.

So after a year Nabuchodonosor sent and caused him to be brought to Babylon with the holy vessels of the Lord, and made Sedekias king of Judea and Jerusalem when he was twenty-one years old. He reigned eleven years. He also did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, and didn’t heed the words that were spoken by Jeremy the prophet from the Lord’s mouth. After King Nabuchodonosor had made him to swear by the name of the Lord, he broke his oath and rebelled. Hardening his neck and his heart, he transgressed the laws of the Lord, the God of Israel. Moreover the governors of the people and of the priests did many things wickedly, exceeding all the defilements of all nations, and defiled the temple of the Lord, which was sanctified in Jerusalem. The God of their ancestors sent by his messenger to call them back, because he had compassion on them and on his dwelling place. But they mocked his messengers. In the day when the Lord spoke, they scoffed at his prophets until he, being angry with his people for their great ungodliness, commanded to bring up the kings of the Chaldeans against them. They killed their young men with the sword around their holy temple, and spared neither young man or young woman, old man or child; but he delivered all of them into their hands. They took all the holy vessels of the Lord, both great and small, with the treasure chests of the Lord’s ark and the king’s treasures, and carried them away to Babylon. They burned the Lord’s house, broke down Jerusalem’s walls, and burned its towers with fire. As for her glorious things, they didn’t stop until they had brought them all to nothing. He carried the people who weren’t slain with the sword to Babylon. They were servants to him and to his children until the Persians reigned, to fulfill the word of the Lord by the mouth of Jeremy: “Until the land has enjoyed its Sabbaths, the whole time of her desolation shall she keep Sabbath, to fulfill seventy years.

### Chapter 2

In the first year of King Cyrus of the Persians, that the word of the Lord by the mouth of Jeremy might be accomplished, the Lord stirred up the spirit of King Cyrus of the Persians, and he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom, and also by writing, saying, “Cyrus king of the Persians says: The Lord of Israel, the Most High Lord, has made me king of the whole world, and commanded me to build him a house at Jerusalem that is in Judea. If therefore there are any of you that are of his people, let the Lord, even his Lord, be with him, and let him go up to Jerusalem that is in Judea, and build the house of the Lord of Israel. He is the Lord who dwells in Jerusalem. Therefore, of those who dwell in various places, let those who are in his own place help each one with gold, with silver, with gifts, with horses, and cattle, beside the other things which have been added by vow for the temple of the Lord which is in Jerusalem.

Then the chief of the families of Judah and of the tribe of Benjamin stood up, with the priests, the Levites, and all whose spirit the Lord had stirred to go up, to build the house for the Lord which is in Jerusalem. Those who lived around them helped them in all things with silver and gold, with horses and cattle, and with very many gifts that were vowed by a great number whose minds were so moved.

King Cyrus also brought out the holy vessels of the Lord, which Nabuchodonosor had carried away from Jerusalem and had stored in his temple of idols. Now when King Cyrus of the Persians had brought them out, he delivered them to Mithradates his treasurer, and by him they were delivered to Sanabassar the governor of Judea. This was the number of them: one thousand gold cups, one thousand silver cups, twenty-nine silver censers, thirty gold bowls, two thousand four hundred ten silver bowls, and one thousand other vessels. So all the vessels of gold and of silver were brought up, even five thousand four hundred seventy-nine, and were carried back by Sanabassar, together with the returning exiles, from Babylon to Jerusalem.

In the time of King Artaxerxes of the Persians, Belemus, Mithradates, Tabellius, Rathumus, Beeltethmus, and Samellius the scribe, with their other associates, dwelling in Samaria and other places, wrote to him against those who lived in Judea and Jerusalem the following letter:

“To King Artaxerxes our Lord, from your servants, Rathumus the recorder, Samellius the scribe, and the rest of their council, and the judges who are in Coelesyria and Phoenicia: Let it now be known to our lord the king, that the Jews that have come up from you to us, having come to Jerusalem, are building that rebellious and wicked city, and are repairing its marketplaces and walls, and are laying the foundation of a temple. Now if this city is built and its walls are finished, they will not only refuse to give tribute, but will even stand up against kings. Since the things pertaining to the temple are now in hand, we think it appropriate not to neglect such a matter, but to speak to our lord the king, to the intent that, if it is your pleasure, search may be made in the books of your ancestors. You will find in the chronicles what is written concerning these things, and will understand that that city was rebellious, troubling both kings and cities, and that the Jews were rebellious, and kept starting wars there in the past. For this cause, this city was laid waste. Therefore now we do declare to you, O lord the king, that if this city is built again, and its walls set up again, you will from then on have no passage into Coelesyria and Phoenicia.”

Then the king wrote back again to Rathumus the recorder, Beeltethmus, Samellius the scribe, and to the rest that of their associates who lived in Samaria, Syria, and Phoenicia, as follows:

“I have read the letter which you have sent to me. Therefore I commanded to make search, and it has been found that that city of old time has fought against kings, and the men were given to rebellion and war in it, and that mighty and fierce kings were in Jerusalem, who reigned and exacted tribute in Coelesyria and Phoenicia. Now therefore I have commanded to prevent those men from building the city, and heed to be taken that there be nothing done contrary to this order, and that those wicked doings proceed no further to the annoyance of kings.” Then King Artaxerxes, his letters being read, Rathumus, and Samellius the scribe, and the rest of their associates, went in haste to Jerusalem with cavalry and a multitude of people in battle array, and began to hinder the builders. So the building of the temple in Jerusalem ceased until the second year of the reign of King Darius of the Persians.

### Chapter 3

Now King Darius made a great feast for all his subjects, for all who were born in his house, for all the princes of Media and of Persia, and for all the local governors and captains and governors who were under him, from India to Ethiopia, in the one hundred twenty seven provinces. They ate and drank, and when they were satisfied went home. Then King Darius went into his bedchamber slept, but awakened out of his sleep.

Then the three young men of the bodyguard, who guarded the king, spoke one to another: “Let every one of us state what one thing is strongest. King Darius will give he whose statement seems wiser than the others great gifts and great honors in token of victory. He shall be clothed in purple, drink from gold cups, sleep on a gold bed, and have a chariot with bridles of gold, a fine linen turban, and a chain around his neck. He shall sit next to Darius because of his wisdom, and shall be called cousin of Darius.”

Then they each wrote his sentence, sealed them, and laid them under King Darius’ pillow, and said, “When the king wakes up, someone will give him the writing. Whoever the king and the three princes of Persia judge that his sentence is the wisest, to him shall the victory be given, as it is written.” The first wrote, “Wine is the strongest.” The second wrote, “The king is strongest.” The third wrote, “Women are strongest, but above all things Truth is the victor.”

Now when the king woke up, they took the writing and gave it to him, so he read it. Sending out, he called all the princes of Persia and of Media, the local governors, the captains, the governors, and the chief officers and sat himself down in the royal seat of judgment; and the writing was read before them. He said, “Call the young men, and they shall explain their own sentences. So they were called and came in. They said to them, “Explain what you have written.”

Then the first, who had spoken of the strength of wine, began and said this: “O sirs, how exceedingly strong wine is! It causes all men who drink it to go astray. It makes the mind of the king and of the fatherless child to be the same, likewise of the bondman and of the freeman, of the poor man and of the rich. It also turns every thought into cheer and mirth, so that a man remembers neither sorrow nor debt. It makes every heart rich, so that a man remembers neither king nor local governor. It makes people say things in large amounts. When they are in their cups, they forget their love both to friends and kindred, and before long draw their swords. But when they awake from their wine, they don’t remember what they have done. O sirs, isn’t wine the strongest, seeing that it forces people to do this?” And when he had said this, he stopped speaking.

### Chapter 4

Then the second, who had spoken of the strength of the king, began to say, “O sirs, don’t men excel in strength who rule over the sea and land, and all things in them? But yet the king is stronger. He is their lord and has dominion over them. In whatever he commands them, they obey him. If he tells them to make war the one against the other, they do it. If he sends them out against the enemies, they go, and conquer mountains, walls, and towers. They kill and are killed, and don’t disobey the king’s commandment. If they win the victory, they bring everything to the king—all the plunder and everything else. Likewise for those who are not soldiers, and don’t have anything to do with wars, but farm, when they have reaped again that which they had sown, they bring some to the king and compel one another to pay tribute to the king. He is just one man! If he commands people to kill, they kill. If he commands them to spare, they spare. If he commands them to strike, they strike. If he commands them to make desolate, they make desolate. If he commands to build, they build. If he commands them to cut down, they cut down. If he commands them to plant, they plant. So all his people and his armies obey him. Furthermore, he lies down, he eats and drinks, and takes his rest; and these keep watch around him. None of them may depart and do his own business. They don’t disobey him in anything. O sirs, how could the king not be the strongest, seeing that he is obeyed like this?” Then he stopped talking.

Then the third, who had spoken of women, and of truth, (this was Zorobabel) began to speak: “O sirs, isn’t the king great, and men are many, and isn’t wine strong? Who is it then who rules them, or has the lordship over them? Aren’t they women? Women have given birth to the king and all the people who rule over sea and land. They came from women. Women nourished up those who planted the vineyards, from where the wine comes. Women also make garments for men. These bring glory to men. Without women, men can’t exist. Yes, and if men have gathered together gold and silver and any other beautiful thing, and see a woman who is lovely in appearance and beauty, they let all those things go and gape at her, and with open mouth stare at her. They all have more desire for her than for gold, or silver, or any other beautiful thing. A man leaves his own father who brought him up, leaves his own country, and joins with his wife. With his wife he ends his days, with no thought for his father, mother, or country. By this also you must know that women have dominion over you. Don’t you labor and toil, and bring it all to give to women? Yes, a man takes his sword and goes out to travel, to rob, to steal, and to sail on the sea and on rivers. He sees a lion and walks in the darkness. When he has stolen, plundered, and robbed, he brings it to the woman he loves. Therefore a man loves his wife better than father or mother. Yes, there are many who have lost their minds for women, and become slaves for their sakes. Many also have perished, have stumbled, and sinned, for women. Now don’t you believe me? Isn’t the king great in his power? Don’t all regions fear to touch him? Yet I saw him and Apame the king’s concubine, the daughter of the illustrious Barticus, sitting at the right hand of the king, and taking the crown from the king’s head, and setting it upon her own head. Yes, she struck the king with her left hand. At this, the king gaped and gazed at her with open mouth. If she smiles at him, he laughs. But if she takes any displeasure at him, he flatters her, that she might be reconciled to him again. O sirs, how can it not be that women are strong, seeing they do this?”

Then the king and the nobles looked at one another. So he began to speak concerning truth. “O sirs, aren’t women strong? The earth is great. The sky is high. The sun is swift in its course, for it circles around the sky, and returns on its course again in one day. Isn’t he who makes these things great? Therefore the truth is great, and stronger than all things. All the earth calls upon truth, and the sky blesses truth. All works shake and tremble, but with truth there is no unrighteous thing. Wine is unrighteous. The king is unrighteous. Women are unrighteous. All the children of men are unrighteous, and all their works are unrighteous. There is no truth in them. They shall also perish in their unrighteousness. But truth remains, and is strong forever. Truth lives and conquers forevermore. With truth there is no partiality toward persons or rewards, but truth does the things that are just, instead of any unrighteous or wicked things. All men approve truth’s works. In truth’s judgment is not any unrighteousness. Truth is the strength, the kingdom, the power, and the majesty of all ages. Blessed be the God of truth!”

With that, he stopped speaking. Then all the people shouted and said, “Great is truth, and strong above all things!”

Then the king said to him, “Ask what you wish, even more than is appointed in writing, and we will give it to you, because you are found wisest. You shall sit next me, and shall be called my cousin.”

Then he said to the king, “Remember your vow, which you vowed to build Jerusalem, in the day when you came to your kingdom, and to send back all the vessels that were taken out of Jerusalem, which Cyrus set apart when he vowed to destroy Babylon, and vowed to send them back there. You also vowed to build the temple which the Edomites burned when Judea was made desolate by the Chaldeans. Now, O lord the king, this is what I request, and what I desire of you, and this is the princely generosity that may proceed from you: I ask therefore that you make good the vow, the performance of which you have vowed to the King of Heaven with your own mouth.”

Then King Darius stood up, kissed him, and wrote letters for him to all the treasurers and governors and captains and local governors, that they should safely bring on their way both him, and all those who would go up with him to build Jerusalem. He wrote letters also to all the governors who were in Coelesyria and Phoenicia, and to them in Libanus, that they should bring cedar wood from Libanus to Jerusalem, and that they should help him build the city. Moreover he wrote for all the Jews who would go out of his realm up into Judea concerning their freedom, that no officer, no governor, no local governor, nor treasurer, should forcibly enter into their doors, and that all the country which they occupied should be free to them without tribute, and that the Edomites should give up the villages of the Jews which they held at that time, and that there should be given twenty talents yearly toward the building of the temple, until the time that it was built, and another ten talents yearly for burnt offerings to be presented upon the altar every day, as they had a commandment to make seventeen offerings, and that all those who would come from Babylonia to build the city should have their freedom—they and their descendants, and all the priests that came. He wrote also to give them their support and the priests’ vestments in which they minister. For the Levites he wrote that their support should be given them until the day that the house was finished and Jerusalem built up. He commanded that land and wages should be given to all who guarded the city. He also sent away all the vessels from Babylon that Cyrus had set apart, and all that Cyrus had given in commandment, he commanded also to be done and to be sent to Jerusalem.

Now when this young man had gone out, he lifted up his face to heaven toward Jerusalem, and praised the King of heaven, and said, “From you comes victory. From you comes wisdom. Yours is the glory, and I am your servant. Blessed are you, who have given me wisdom. I give thanks to you, O Lord of our fathers. So he took the letters, went out, came to Babylon, and told it all his kindred. They praised the God of their ancestors, because he had given them freedom and liberty to go up and to build Jerusalem and the temple which is called by his name. They feasted with instruments of music and gladness seven days.

### Chapter 5

After this, the chiefs of fathers’ houses were chosen to go up according to their tribes, with their wives, sons, and daughters, with their menservants and maidservants, and their livestock. Darius sent with them one thousand cavalry to bring them back to Jerusalem with peace, with musical instruments, drums, and flutes. All their kindred were making merry, and he made them go up together with them.

These are the names of the men who went up, according to their families among their tribes, after their several divisions. The priests, the sons of Phinees, the sons of Aaron: Jesus the son of Josedek, the son of Saraias, and Joakim the son of Zorobabel, the son of Salathiel, of the house of David, of the lineage of Phares, of the tribe of Judah, who spoke wise words before Darius the king of Persia in the second year of his reign, in the month Nisan, which is the first month.

These are the of Judeans who came up from the captivity, where they lived as foreigners, whom Nabuchodonosor the king of Babylon had carried away to Babylon. They returned to Jerusalem and to the other parts of Judea, every man to his own city, who came with Zorobabel, with Jesus, Nehemias, Zaraias, Resaias, Eneneus, Mardocheus, Beelsarus, Aspharsus, Reelias, Roimus, and Baana, their leaders.

The number of them of the nation and their leaders: the sons of Phoros, two thousand one hundred seventy two; the sons of Saphat, four hundred seventy two; the sons of Ares, seven hundred fifty six; the sons of Phaath Moab, of the sons of Jesus and Joab, two thousand eight hundred twelve; the sons of Elam, one thousand two hundred fifty four; the sons of Zathui, nine hundred forty five; the sons of Chorbe, seven hundred five; the sons of Bani, six hundred forty eight; the sons of Bebai, six hundred twenty three; the sons of Astad, one thousand three hundred twenty two; the sons of Adonikam, six hundred sixty seven; the sons of Bagoi, two thousand sixty six; the sons of Adinu, four hundred fifty four; the sons of Ater, of Ezekias, ninety two; the sons of Kilan and Azetas, sixty seven; the sons of Azaru, four hundred thirty two; the sons of Annis, one hundred one; the sons of Arom, the sons of Bassai, three hundred twenty three; the sons of Arsiphurith, one hundred twelve; the sons of Baiterus, three thousand five; the sons of Bethlomon, one hundred twenty three; those from Netophas, fifty five; those from Anathoth, one hundred fifty eight; those from Bethasmoth, forty two; those from Kariathiarius, twenty five: those from Caphira and Beroth, seven hundred forty three; the Chadiasai and Ammidioi, four hundred twenty two; those from Kirama and Gabbe, six hundred twenty one; those from Macalon, one hundred twenty two; those from Betolion, fifty two; the sons of Niphis, one hundred fifty six; the sons of Calamolalus and Onus, seven hundred twenty five; the sons of Jerechu, three hundred forty five; and the sons of Sanaas, three thousand three hundred thirty.

The priests: the sons of Jeddu, the son of Jesus, among the sons of Sanasib, nine hundred seventy two; the sons of Emmeruth, one thousand fifty two; the sons of Phassurus, one thousand two hundred forty seven; and the sons of Charme, one thousand seventeen. The Levites: the sons of Jesus, Kadmiel, Bannas, and Sudias, seventy four. The holy singers: the sons of Asaph, one hundred twenty eight. The gatekeepers: the sons of Salum, the sons of Atar, the sons of Tolman, the sons of Dacubi, the sons of Ateta, the sons of Sabi, in all one hundred thirty nine.

The temple servants: the sons of Esau, the sons of Asipha, the sons of Tabaoth, the sons of Keras, the sons of Sua, the sons of Phaleas, the sons of Labana, the sons of Aggaba. the sons of Acud, the sons of Uta, the sons of Ketab, the sons of Accaba, the sons of Subai, the sons of Anan, the sons of Cathua, the sons of Geddur, the sons of Jairus, the sons of Daisan, the sons of Noeba, the sons of Chaseba, the sons of Gazera, the sons of Ozias, the sons of Phinoe, the sons of Asara, the sons of Basthai, the sons of Asana, the sons of Maani, the sons of Naphisi, the sons of Acub, the sons of Achipha, the sons of Asur, the sons of Pharakim, the sons of Basaloth, the sons of Meedda, the sons of Cutha, the sons of Charea, the sons of Barchus, the sons of Serar, the sons of Thomei, the sons of Nasi, the sons of Atipha.

The sons of the servants of Solomon: the sons of Assaphioth, the sons of Pharida, the sons of Jeeli, the sons of Lozon, the sons of Isdael, the sons of Saphuthi, the sons of Agia, the sons of Phacareth, the sons of Sabie, the sons of Sarothie, the sons of Masias, the sons of Gas, the sons of Addus, the sons of Subas, the sons of Apherra, the sons of Barodis, the sons of Saphat, the sons of Allon.

All the temple-servants and the sons of the servants of Solomon were three hundred seventy two. These came up from Thermeleth, and Thelersas, Charaathalan leading them, and Allar; and they could not show their families, nor their stock, how they were of Israel: the sons of Dalan the son of Ban, the sons of Nekodan, six hundred fifty two.

Of the priests, those who usurped the office of the priesthood and were not found: the sons of Obdia, the sons of Akkos, the sons of Jaddus, who married Augia one of the daughters of Zorzelleus, and was called after his name. When the description of the kindred of these men was sought in the register and was not found, they were removed from executing the office of the priesthood; for Nehemias and Attharias told them that they should not be partakers of the holy things until a high priest wearing Urim and Thummim should arise.

So all those of Israel, from twelve years old and upward, beside menservants and women servants, were in number forty two thousand three hundred sixty. Their menservants and handmaids were seven thousand three hundred thirty and seven; the minstrels and singers, two hundred forty five; four hundred thirty and five camels, seven thousand thirty six horses, two hundred forty five mules, and five thousand five hundred twenty five beasts of burden.

And some of the chief men of their families, when they came to the temple of God that is in Jerusalem, vowed to set up the house again in its own place according to their ability, and to give into the holy treasury of the works one thousand minas of gold, five thousand minas of silver, and one hundred priestly vestments.

The priests and the Levites and some of the people lived in Jerusalem and the country. The holy singers also and the gatekeepers and all Israel lived in their villages.

But when the seventh month was at hand, and when the children of Israel were each in their own place, they all came together with one purpose into the broad place before the first porch which is toward the east. Then Jesus the son of Josedek, his kindred the priests, Zorobabel the son of Salathiel, and his kindred stood up and made the altar of the God of Israel ready to offer burned sacrifices upon it, in accordance with the express commands in the book of Moses the man of God. Some people joined them out of the other nations of the land, and they erected the altar upon its own place, because all the nations of the land were hostile to them and oppressed them; and they offered sacrifices at the proper times and burnt offerings to the Lord both morning and evening. They also held the feast of tabernacles, as it is commanded in the law, and offered sacrifices daily, as appropriate. After that, they offered the continual oblations and the sacrifices of the Sabbaths, of the new moons, and of all the consecrated feasts. All those who had made any vow to God began to offer sacrifices to God from the new moon of the seventh month, although the temple of God was not yet built. They gave money, food, and drink to the masons and carpenters. They also gave carts to the people of Sidon and Tyre, that they should bring cedar trees from Libanus, and convey them in rafts to the harbor of Joppa, according to the commandment which was written for them by Cyrus king of the Persians.

In the second year after his coming to the temple of God at Jerusalem, in the second month, Zorobabel the son of Salathiel, Jesus the son of Josedek, their kindred, the Levitical priests, and all those who had come to Jerusalem out of the captivity began work. They laid the foundation of God’s temple on the new moon of the second month, in the second year after they had come to Judea and Jerusalem. They appointed the Levites who were at least twenty years old over the Lord’s works. Then Jesus, with his sons and kindred, Kadmiel his brother, the sons of Jesus, Emadabun, and the sons of Joda the son of Iliadun, and their sons and kindred, all the Levites, with one accord stood up and started the business, laboring to advance the works in the house of God. So the builders built the Lord’s temple.

The priests stood arrayed in their vestments with musical instruments and trumpets, and the Levites the sons of Asaph with their cymbals, singing songs of thanksgiving and praising the Lord, according to the directions of King David of Israel. They sang aloud, praising the Lord in songs of thanksgiving, because his goodness and his glory are forever in all Israel. All the people sounded trumpets and shouted with a loud voice, singing songs of thanksgiving to the Lord for the raising up of the Lord’s house. Some of the Levitical priests and of the heads of their families, the elderly who had seen the former house came to the building of this one with lamentation and great weeping. But many with trumpets and joy shouted with a loud voice, so that the people couldn’t hear the trumpets for the weeping of the people, for the multitude sounded loudly, so that it was heard far away.

Therefore when the enemies of the tribe of Judah and Benjamin heard it, they came to know what that noise of trumpets meant. They learned that those who returned from captivity built the temple for the Lord, the God of Israel. So they went to Zorobabel and Jesus, and to the chief men of the families, and said to them, “We will build together with you. For we, just like you, obey your Lord, and sacrifice to him from the days of King Asbasareth of the Assyrians, who brought us here.”

Then Zorobabel, Jesus and the chief men of the families of Israel said to them, “It is not for you to build the house for the Lord our God. We ourselves alone will build for the Lord of Israel, as King Cyrus of the Persians has commanded us.” But the heathen of the land pressed hard upon the inhabitants of Judea, cut off their supplies, and hindered their building. By their secret plots, and popular persuasions and commotions, they hindered the finishing of the building all the time that King Cyrus lived. So they were hindered from building for two years, until the reign of Darius.

### Chapter 6

Now in the second year of the reign of Darius, Aggaeus and Zacharius the son of Addo, the prophets, prophesied to the Jews in Judea and Jerusalem in the name of the Lord, the God of Israel. Then Zorobabel the son of Salathiel and Jesus the son of Josedek stood up and began to build the house of the Lord at Jerusalem, the prophets of the Lord being with them and helping them.

At the same time Sisinnes the governor of Syria and Phoenicia came to them, with Sathrabuzanes and his companions, and said to them, “By whose authority do you build this house and this roof, and perform all the other things? Who are the builders who do these things?” Nevertheless, the elders of the Jews obtained favor, because the Lord had visited the captives; and they were not hindered from building until such time as communication was made to Darius concerning them, and his answer received.

A copy of the letter which Sisinnes, governor of Syria and Phoenicia, and Sathrabuzanes, with their companions, the rulers in Syria and Phoenicia, wrote and sent to Darius:

“To King Darius, greetings. Let it be fully known to our lord the king, that having come into the country of Judea, and entered into the city of Jerusalem, we found in the city of Jerusalem the elders of the Jews that were of the captivity building a great new house for the Lord of hewn and costly stones, with timber laid in the walls. Those works are being done with great speed. The work goes on prosperously in their hands, and it is being accomplished with all glory and diligence. Then asked we these elders, saying, ‘By whose authority are you building this house and laying the foundations of these works?’ Therefore, to the intent that we might give knowledge to you by writing who were the leaders, we questioned them, and we required of them the names in writing of their principal men. So they gave us this answer, ‘We are the servants of the Lord who made heaven and earth. As for this house, it was built many years ago by a great and strong king of Israel, and was finished. But when our fathers sinned against the Lord of Israel who is in heaven, and provoked him to wrath, he gave them over into the hands of King Nabuchodonosor of Babylon, king of the Chaldeans. They pulled down the house, burned it, and carried away the people captive to Babylon. But in the first year that Cyrus reigned over the country of Babylon, King Cyrus wrote that this house should be rebuilt. The holy vessels of gold and of silver that Nabuchodonosor had carried away out of the house at Jerusalem and had set up in his own temple, those King Cyrus brought out of the temple in Babylonia, and they were delivered to Zorobabel and to Sanabassarus the governor, with commandment that he should carry away all these vessels, and put them in the temple at Jerusalem, and that the Lord’s temple should be built on its site. Then Sanabassarus, having come here, laid the foundations of the Lord’s house which is in Jerusalem. From that time to this we are still building. It is not yet fully completed.’ Now therefore, if it seems good, O king, let a search be made among the royal archives of our lord the king that are in Babylon. If it is found that the building of the house of the Lord which is in Jerusalem has been done with the consent of King Cyrus, and it seems good to our lord the king, let him send us directions concerning these things.”

Then King Darius commanded that a search be made among the archives that were laid up at Babylon. So at Ekbatana the palace, which is in the country of Media, a scroll was found where these things were recorded: “In the first year of the reign of Cyrus, King Cyrus commanded to build up the house of the Lord which is in Jerusalem, where they sacrifice with continual fire. Its height shall be sixty cubits, and the breadth sixty cubits, with three rows of hewn stones, and one row of new wood from that country. Its expenses are to be given out of the house of King Cyrus. The holy vessels of the house of the Lord, both gold and silver, that Nabuchodonosor took out of the house at Jerusalem and carried away to Babylon, should be restored to the house at Jerusalem, and be set in the place where they were before.” Also he commanded that Sisinnes the governor of Syria and Phoenicia, and Sathrabuzanes, and their companions, and those who were appointed rulers in Syria and Phoenicia, should be careful not to meddle with the place, but allow Zorobabel, the servant of the Lord, and governor of Judea, and the elders of the Jews, to build that house of the Lord in its place. “I also command to have it built up whole again; and that they look diligently to help those who are of the captivity of Judea, until the house of the Lord is finished, and that out of the tribute of Coelesyria and Phoenicia a portion shall be carefully given to these men for the sacrifices of the Lord, that is, to Zorobabel the governor for bulls, rams, and lambs, and also corn, salt, wine and oil, and that continually every year without further question, according as the priests who are in Jerusalem may direct to be daily spent, that drink offerings may be made to the Most High God for the king and for his children, and that they may pray for their lives.” He commanded that whoever should transgress, yes, or neglect anything written here, a beam shall be taken out of his own house, and he shall be hanged on it, and all his goods seized for the king. “Therefore may the Lord, whose name is called upon there, utterly destroy every king and nation that stretches out his hand to hinder or damage that house of the Lord in Jerusalem. I, King Darius have ordained that these things be done with diligence.”

### Chapter 7

Then Sisinnes the governor of Coelesyria and Phoenicia, and Sathrabuzanes, with their companions, following the commandments of King Darius, very carefully supervised the holy work, assisting the elders of the Jews and rulers of the temple. So the holy work prospered, while Aggaeus and Zacharias the prophets prophesied. They finished these things by the commandment of the Lord, the God of Israel, and with the consent of Cyrus, Darius, and Artaxerxes, kings of the Persians. So the holy house was finished by the twenty-third day of the month Adar, in the sixth year of King Darius. The children of Israel, the priests, the Levites, and the others who returned from captivity who joined them did what was written in the book of Moses. For the dedication of the Lord’s temple, they offered one hundred bulls, two hundred rams, four hundred lambs, and twelve male goats for the sin of all Israel, according to the number of the twelve princes of the tribes of Israel. The priests and the Levites stood arrayed in their vestments, according to their kindred, for the services of the Lord, the God of Israel, according to the book of Moses. The gatekeepers were at every gate.

The children of Israel who came out of captivity held the Passover the fourteenth day of the first month, when the priests and the Levites were sanctified together, with all those who returned from captivity; for they were sanctified. For the Levites were all sanctified together, and they offered the Passover for all who returned from captivity, for their kindred the priests, and for themselves. The children of Israel who came out of the captivity ate, even all those who had separated themselves from the abominations of the heathen of the land, and sought the Lord. They kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days, rejoicing before the Lord, because he had turned the counsel of the king of Assyria toward them, to strengthen their hands in the works of the Lord, the God of Israel.

### Chapter 8

After these things, when Artaxerxes the king of the Persians reigned, Esdras came, who was the son of Azaraias, the son of Zechrias, the son of Helkias, the son of Salem, the son of Sadduk, the son of Ahitob, the son of Amarias, the son of Ozias, the son of Memeroth, the son of Zaraias, the son of Savias, the son of Boccas, the son of Abisne, the son of Phinees, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, the chief priest. This Esdras went up from Babylon as a skilled scribe in the law of Moses, which was given by the God of Israel. The king honored him, for he found favor in his sight in all his requests. There went up with him also some of the children of Israel, and of the priests, Levites, holy singers, gatekeepers, and temple servants to Jerusalem in the seventh year of the reign of Artaxerxes, in the fifth month (this was the king’s seventh year); for they left Babylon on the new moon of the first month and came to Jerusalem, by the prosperous journey which the Lord gave them for his sake. For Esdras had very great skill, so that he omitted nothing of the law and commandments of the Lord, but taught all Israel the ordinances and judgments.

Now the commission, which was written from King Artaxerxes, came to Esdras the priest and reader of the law of the Lord, was as follows:

“King Artaxerxes to Esdras the priest and reader of the law of the Lord, greetings. Having determined to deal graciously, I have given orders that those of the nation of the Jews, and of the priests and Levites, and of those within our realm who are willing and freely choose to, should go with you to Jerusalem. As many therefore as are so disposed, let them depart with you, as it has seemed good both to me and my seven friends the counselors, that they may look to the affairs of Judea and Jerusalem, in accordance with what is in the Lord’s law, and carry the gifts to the Lord of Israel to Jerusalem, which I and my friends have vowed, and that all the gold and silver that can be found in the country of Babylonia for the Lord in Jerusalem, with that also which is given of the people for the temple of the Lord their God that is at Jerusalem, be collected: even the gold and silver for bulls, rams, and lambs, and what goes with them, to the end that they may offer sacrifices to the Lord upon the altar of the Lord their God, which is in Jerusalem. Whatever you and your kindred decide to do with gold and silver, do that according to the will of your God. The holy vessels of the Lord, which are given you for the use of the temple of your God, which is in Jerusalem, and whatever else you shall remember for the use of the temple of your God, you shall give it out of the king’s treasury. I, King Artaxerxes, have also commanded the keepers of the treasures in Syria and Phoenicia, that whatever Esdras the priest and reader of the law of the Most High God shall send for, they should give it to him with all diligence, to the sum of one hundred talents of silver, likewise also of wheat even to one hundred cors, and one hundred firkins of wine, and salt in abundance. Let all things be performed after God’s law diligently to the most high God, that wrath come not upon the kingdom of the king and his sons. I command you also that no tax, nor any other imposition, be laid upon any of the priests, or Levites, or holy singers, or gatekeepers, or temple servants, or any that have employment in this temple, and that no man has authority to impose any tax on them. You, Esdras, according to the wisdom of God, ordain judges and justices that they may judge in all Syria and Phoenicia all those who know the law of your God; and those who don’t know it, you shall teach. Whoever transgresses the law of your God and of the king shall be punished diligently, whether it be by death, or other punishment, by penalty of money, or by imprisonment.”

Then Esdras the scribe said, “Blessed be the only Lord, the God of my fathers, who has put these things into the heart of the king, to glorify his house that is in Jerusalem, and has honored me in the sight of the king, his counselors, and all his friends and nobles. Therefore I was encouraged by the help of the Lord my God, and gathered together out of Israel men to go up with me.

These are the chief according to their families and their several divisions, who went up with me from Babylon in the reign of King Artaxerxes: of the sons of Phinees, Gerson; of the sons of Ithamar, Gamael; of the sons of David, Attus the son of Sechenias; of the sons of Phoros, Zacharais; and with him were counted one hundred fifty men; of the sons of Phaath Moab, Eliaonias the son of Zaraias, and with him two hundred men; of the sons of Zathoes, Sechenias the son of Jezelus, and with him three hundred men; of the sons of Adin, Obeth the son of Jonathan, and with him two hundred fifty men; of the sons of Elam, Jesias son of Gotholias, and with him seventy men; of the sons of Saphatias, Zaraias son of Michael, and with him seventy men; of the sons of Joab, Abadias son of Jehiel. Jezelus, and with him two hundred twelve men; of the sons of Banias, Salimoth son of Josaphias, and with him one hundred sixty men; of the sons of Babi, Zacharias son of Bebai, and with him twenty-eight men; of the sons of Azgad: Astath, Joannes son of Hakkatan Akatan, and with him one hundred ten men; of the sons of Adonikam, the last, and these are the names of them, Eliphalat, Jeuel, and Samaias, and with them seventy men; of the sons of Bago, Uthi the son of Istalcurus, and with him seventy men.

I gathered them together to the river called Theras. There we pitched our tents three days, and I inspected them. When I had found there none of the priests and Levites, then sent I to Eleazar, Iduel, Maasmas, Elnathan, Samaias, Joribus, Nathan, Ennatan, Zacharias, and Mosollamus, principal men and men of understanding. I asked them to go to Loddeus the captain, who was in the place of the treasury, and commanded them that they should speak to Loddeus, to his kindred, and to the treasurers in that place, to send us such men as might execute the priests’ office in our Lord’s house. By the mighty hand of our Lord, they brought to us men of understanding of the sons of Mooli the son of Levi, the son of Israel, Asebebias, and his sons, and his kindred, who were eighteen, and Asebias, Annuus, and Osaias his brother, of the sons of Chanuneus, and their sons were twenty men; and of the temple servants whom David and the principal men had appointed for the servants of the Levites, two hundred twenty temple servants. The list of all their names was reported.

There I vowed a fast for the young men before our Lord, to seek from him a prosperous journey both for us and for our children and livestock that were with us; for I was ashamed to ask of the king infantry, cavalry, and an escort for protection against our adversaries. For we had said to the king that the power of our Lord would be with those who seek him, to support them in all ways. Again we prayed to our lord about these things, and found him to be merciful.

Then I set apart twelve men of the chiefs of the priests, Eserebias, Assamias, and ten men of their kindred with them. I weighed out to them the silver, the gold, and the holy vessels of the house of our Lord, which the king, his counselors, the nobles, and all Israel had given. When I had weighed it, I delivered to them six hundred fifty talents of silver, silver vessels weighing one hundred talents, one hundred talents of gold, twenty golden vessels, and twelve vessels of brass, even of fine brass, glittering like gold. I said to them, “You are holy to the Lord, the vessels are holy, and the gold and the silver are a vow to the Lord, the Lord of our fathers. Watch and keep them until you deliver them to the chiefs of the priests and Levites, and to the principal men of the families of Israel in Jerusalem, in the chambers of our Lord’s house. So the priests and the Levites who received the silver, the gold, and the vessels which were in Jerusalem, brought them into the temple of the Lord.

We left the river Theras on the twelfth day of the first month. We came to Jerusalem by the mighty hand of our Lord which was upon us. The Lord delivered us from from every enemy on the way, and so we came to Jerusalem. When we had been there three days, the silver and gold was weighed and delivered in our Lord’s house on the fourth day to Marmoth the priest the son of Urias. With him was Eleazar the son of Phinees, and with them were Josabdus the son of Jesus and Moeth the son of Sabannus, the Levites. All was delivered to them by number and weight. All the weight of them was recorded at the same hour. Moreover those who had come out of captivity offered sacrifices to the Lord, the God of Israel, even twelve bulls for all Israel, ninety-six rams, seventy-two lambs, and twelve goats for a peace offering—all of them a sacrifice to the Lord. They delivered the king’s commandments to the king’s stewards and to the governors of Coelesyria and Phoenicia; and they honored the people and the temple of the Lord.

Now when these things were done, the principal men came to me and said, “The nation of Israel, the princes, the priests, and the Levites haven’t put away from themselves the foreign people of the land nor the uncleannesses of the Gentiles—the Canaanites, Hittites, Pherezites, Jebusites, Moabites, Egyptians, and Edomites. For both they and their sons have married with their daughters, and the holy seed is mixed with the foreign people of the land. From the beginning of this matter the rulers and the nobles have been partakers of this iniquity.”

And as soon as I had heard these things, I tore my clothes and my holy garment, and plucked the hair from off my head and beard, and sat down sad and full of heaviness. So all those who were moved at the word of the Lord, the God of Israel, assembled to me while I mourned for the iniquity, but I sat still full of heaviness until the evening sacrifice. Then rising up from the fast with my clothes and my holy garment torn, and bowing my knees and stretching out my hands to the Lord, I said, “O Lord, I am ashamed and confounded before your face, for our sins are multiplied above our heads, and our errors have reached up to heaven ever since the time of our fathers. We are in great sin, even to this day. For our sins and our fathers’ we with our kindred, our kings, and our priests were given up to the kings of the earth, to the sword, and to captivity, and for a prey with shame, to this day. Now in some measure mercy has been shown to us from you, O Lord, that there should be left us a root and a name in the place of your sanctuary, and to uncover a light in the house of the Lord our God, and to give us food in the time of our servitude. Yes, when we were in bondage, we were not forsaken by our Lord, but he gave us favor before the kings of Persia, so that they gave us food, glorified the temple of our Lord, and raised up the desolate Zion, to give us a sure dwelling in Judea and Jerusalem.

“Now, O Lord, what shall we say, having these things? For we have transgressed your commandments which you gave by the hand of your servants the prophets, saying, ‘The land, which you enter into to possess as an inheritance, is a land polluted with the pollutions of the foreigners of the land, and they have filled it with their uncleanness. Therefore now you shall not join your daughters to their sons, neither shall you take their daughters for your sons. You shall never seek to have peace with them, that you may be strong, and eat the good things of the land, and that you may leave it for an inheritance to your children for evermore.’ All that has happened is done to us for our wicked works and great sins, for you, O Lord, made our sins light, and gave to us such a root; but we have turned back again to transgress your law in mingling ourselves with the uncleanness of the heathen of the land. You weren’t angry with us to destroy us until you had left us neither root, seed, nor name. O Lord of Israel, you are true, for we are left a root this day. Behold, now we are before you in our iniquities, for we can’t stand any longer before you because of these things.”

As Esdras in his prayer made his confession, weeping, and lying flat on the ground before the temple, a very great throng of men, women, and children gathered to him from Jerusalem; for there was great weeping among the multitude. Then Jechonias the son of Jeelus, one of the sons of Israel, called out, and said, “O Esdras, we have sinned against the Lord God, we have married foreign women of the heathen of the land, but there is still hope for Israel. Let’s make an oath to the Lord about this, that we will put away all our foreign wives with their children, as seems good to you, and to as many as obey the Lord’s Law. Arise, and take action, for this is your task, and we will be with you to do valiantly.” So Esdras arose, and took an oath from the chief of the priests and Levites of all Israel to do these things; and they swore to it.

### Chapter 9

Then Esdras rose up from the court of the temple and went to the chamber of Jonas the son of Eliasib, and lodged there, and ate no bread and drank no water, mourning for the great iniquities of the multitude. A proclamation was made in all Judea and Jerusalem to all those who returned from captivity, that they should be gathered together at Jerusalem, and that whoever didn’t meet there within two or three days, in accordance with the ruling of the elders, that their livestock would be seized for the use of the temple, and they would be expelled from the multitude of those who returned from captivity.

Within three days, all those of the tribe of Judah and Benjamin gathered together at Jerusalem. This was the ninth month, on the twentieth day of the month. All the multitude sat together shivering in the broad place before the temple because of the present foul weather. So Esdras arose up and said to them, “You have transgressed the law and married foreign wives, increasing the sins of Israel. Now make confession and give glory to the Lord, the God of our fathers, and do his will, and separate yourselves from the heathen of the land, and from the foreign women.”

Then the whole multitude cried out, and said with a loud voice, “Just as you have spoken, so we will do. But because the multitude is great, and it is foul weather, so that we can’t stand outside, and this is not a work of one day or two, seeing our sin in these things has spread far, therefore let the rulers of the multitude stay, and let all those of our settlements that have foreign wives come at the time appointed, and with them the rulers and judges of every place, until we turn away the wrath of the Lord from us for this matter.”

So Jonathan the son of Azael and Ezekias the son of Thocanus took the matter on themselves. Mosollamus and Levis and Sabbateus were judges with them. Those who returned from captivity did according to all these things.

Esdras the priest chose for himself principal men of their families, all by name. On the new moon of the tenth month they met together to examine the matter. So their cases of men who had foreign wives was brought to an end by the new moon of the first month.

Of the priests who had come together and had foreign wives, there were found of the sons of Jesus the son of Josedek, and his kindred, Mathelas, Eleazar, and Joribus, and Joadanus. They gave their hands to put away their wives, and to offer rams to make reconciliation for their error. Of the sons of Emmer: Ananias, Zabdeus, Manes, Sameus, Hiereel, and Azarias. Of the sons of Phaisur: Elionas, Massias, Ishmael, Nathanael, Ocidelus, and Saloas.

Of the Levites: Jozabdus, Semeis, Colius who was called Calitas, Patheus, Judas, and Jonas. Of the holy singers: Eliasibus and Bacchurus. Of the gatekeepers: Sallumus and Tolbanes.

Of Israel, of the sons of Phoros: Hiermas, Ieddias, Melchias, Maelus, Eleazar, Asibas, and Banneas. Of the sons of Ela: Matthanias, Zacharias, Jezrielus, Oabdius, Hieremoth, and Aedias. Of the sons of Zamoth: Eliadas, Eliasimus, Othonias, Jarimoth, Sabathus, and Zardeus. Of the sons of Bebai: Joannes, Ananias, Jozabdus, and Ematheis. Of the sons of Mani: Olamus, Mamuchus, Jedeus, Jasubas, Jasaelus, and Hieremoth. Of the sons of Addi: Naathus, Moossias, Laccunus, Naidus, Matthanias, Sesthel, Balnuus, and Manasseas. Of the sons of Annas: Elionas, Aseas, Melchias, Sabbeus, and Simon Chosameus. Of the sons of Asom: Maltanneus, Mattathias, Sabanneus, Eliphalat, Manasses, and Semei. Of the sons of Baani: Jeremias, Momdis, Ismaerus, Juel, Mamdai, Pedias, Anos, Carabasion, Enasibus, Mamnitamenus, Eliasis, Bannus, Eliali, Someis, Selemias, and Nathanias. Of the sons of Ezora: Sesis, Ezril, Azaelus, Samatus, Zambri, and Josephus. Of the sons of Nooma: Mazitias, Zabadeas, Edos, Juel, and Banaias. All these had taken foreign wives, and they put them away with their children.

The priests and Levites, and those who were of Israel, lived in Jerusalem and in the country, on the new moon of the seventh month, and the children of Israel in their settlements.

The whole multitude gathered together with one accord into the broad place before the porch of the temple toward the east. They said to Esdras the priest and reader, “Bring the law of Moses that was given by the Lord, the God of Israel.”

So Esdras the chief priest brought the law to the whole multitude both of men and women, and to all the priests, to hear the law on the new moon of the seventh month. He read in the broad place before the porch of the temple from morning until midday, before both men and women; and all the multitude gave attention to the law. Esdras the priest and reader of the law stood up upon the pulpit of wood which had been prepared. Beside him stood Mattathias, Sammus, Ananias, Azarias, Urias, Ezekias, and Baalsamus on the right hand, and on his left hand, Phaldeus, Misael, Melchias, Lothasubus, Nabarias, and Zacharias. Then Esdras took the book of the law before the multitude, and sat honorably in the first place before all. When he opened the law, they all stood straight up. So Esdras blessed the Lord God Most High, the God of armies, the Almighty. All the people answered, “Amen.” Lifting up their hands, they fell to the ground and worshiped the Lord. Also Jesus, Annus, Sarabias, Iadinus, Jacubus, Sabateus, Auteas, Maiannas, Calitas, Azarias, Jozabdus, Ananias, and Phalias, the Levites, taught the law of the Lord, and read to the multitude the law of the Lord, explaining what was read.

Then Attharates said to Esdras the chief priest and reader, and to the Levites who taught the multitude, even to all, “This day is holy to the Lord—now they all wept when they heard the law— go then, eat the fat, drink the sweet, and send portions to those who have nothing; for the day is holy to the Lord. Don’t be sorrowful, for the Lord will bring you to honor.” So the Levites commanded all things to the people, saying, “This day is holy. Don’t be sorrowful.” Then they went their way, every one to eat, drink, enjoy themselves, to give portions to those who had nothing, and to rejoice greatly, because they understood the words they were instructed with, and for which they had been assembled.

## Prayer of Manasses

The Prayer of Manasses, King of Judah, When He Was Held Captive in Babylon

The Prayer of Manasses is recognized as Deuterocanonical Scripture by the Greek Orthodox and Russian Orthodox Churches. It is included in an appendix to the Latin Vulgate Bible.

### Chapter 1

O LORD Almighty in heaven, God of our fathers Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and of their righteous offspring, you who have made heaven and earth, with all their order, who have bound the sea by the word of your commandment, who have shut up the deep, and sealed it by your terrible and glorious name, whom all things fear, yes, tremble before your power, for the majesty of your glory can’t be borne, and the anger of your threatening toward sinners is unbearable. Your merciful promise is unmeasurable and unsearchable, for you are the Lord Most High, of great compassion, patient and abundant in mercy, and relent at human suffering. You, O Lord, according to your great goodness have promised repentance and forgiveness to those who have sinned against you. Of your infinite mercies, you have appointed repentance to sinners, that they may be saved. You therefore, O Lord, who are the God of the just, have not appointed repentance to the just, to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, which have not sinned against you, but you have appointed repentance to me who am a sinner. For I have sinned more than the number of the sands of the sea. My transgressions are multiplied, O Lord, my transgressions are multiplied, and I am not worthy to behold and see the height of heaven for the multitude of my iniquities. I am bowed down with many iron bands, so that I can’t lift up my head by reason of my sins, neither have I any relief; for I have provoked your wrath, and done that which is evil before you: I didn’t do your will, neither did I keep your commandments. I have set up abominations, and have multiplied detestable things. Now therefore I bow the knee of my heart, asking you for grace. I have sinned, O Lord, I have sinned, and I acknowledge my iniquities; but, I humbly ask you, forgive me, O Lord, forgive me, and please don’t destroy me with my iniquities. Don’t be angry with me forever, by reserving evil for me. Don’t condemn me into the lower parts of the earth. For you, O Lord, are the God of those who repent. In me you will show all your goodness, for you will save me, who am unworthy, according to your great mercy. Then I will praise you forever all the days of my life; for all the army of heaven sings your praise, and yours is the glory forever and ever. Amen.

## Psalm 151

Psalm 151 is recognized as Deuterocanonical Scripture by the Greek Orthodox and Russian Orthodox Churches.

### Psalm 151

This Psalm is a genuine one of David, though extra, composed when he fought in single combat with Goliath.

I was small among my brothers,

and youngest in my father’s house.

I tended my father’s sheep.

My hands formed a musical instrument,

and my fingers tuned a lyre.

Who shall tell my Lord?

The Lord himself, he himself hears.

He sent forth his angel and took me from my father’s sheep,

and he anointed me with his anointing oil.

My brothers were handsome and tall;

but the Lord didn’t take pleasure in them.

I went out to meet the Philistine,

and he cursed me by his idols.

But I drew his own sword and beheaded him,

and removed reproach from the children of Israel.

## 3 Maccabees

The Third Book of the Maccabees is recognized as Deuterocanonical Scripture by the Greek Orthodox and Russian Orthodox Churches. It is considered to be apocrypha by most other church traditions.

### Chapter 1

Now Philopater, on learning from those who came back that Antiochus had made himself master of the places which belonged to himself, sent orders to all his infantry and cavalry, took with him his sister Arsinoe, and marched out as far as the parts of Raphia, where Antiochus and his forces encamped. And one Theodotus, intending to carry out his design, took with him the bravest of the armed men who had been before committed to his trust by Ptolemy, and got through at night to the tent of Ptolemy, to kill him on his own responsibility, and so to end the war. But Dositheus, called the son of Drimulus, by birth a Jew, afterward a renegade from the laws and observances of his country, conveyed Ptolemy away, and made an obscure person lie down in his stead in the tent. It turned out that this man received the fate which was meant for the other. A fierce battle then took place. The men of Antiochus were prevailing. Arsinoe continually went up and down the ranks, and with dishevelled hair, with tears and entreaties, begged the soldiers to fight bravely for themselves, their children, and wives, and promised that if they proved conquerors, she would give them each two minas of gold. It thus fell out that their enemies were defeated in hand-to-hand encounter, and that many of them were taken prisoners. Having vanquished this attempt, the king then decided to proceed to the neighboring cities, and encourage them. By doing this, and by making donations to their temples, he inspired his subjects with confidence.

The Jews sent some of their council and of their elders to him. The greetings, welcoming gifts, and congratulations of the past, given by them, filled him with the greater eagerness to visit their city. Having arrived at Jerusalem, sacrificed, and offered thank-offerings to the Greatest God, and done whatever else was suitable to the sanctity of the place, and entered the inner court, he was so impressed with the magnificence of the place, and so wondered at the orderly arrangements of the temple, that he considered entering the sanctuary itself. When they told him that this was not permissible, none of the nation, not even the priests in general, but only the supreme high priest of all, and he only once in a year, was allowed to go in, he would by no means give way. Then they read the law to him, but he persisted in intruding, exclaiming that he ought to be allowed. He said, “Even if they were deprived of this honor, I shouldn’t be.” He asked why, when he entered all the other temples, did none of the priests who were present forbid him. He was thoroughly answered by someone, that he did wrong to boast of this. “Well, since I have done this,” said he, “be the cause what it may, shall I not enter with or without your consent?”

When the priests fell down in their sacred vestments imploring the Greatest God to come and help in time of need, and to avert the violence of the fierce aggressor, and when they filled the temple with lamentations and tears, then those who had been left behind in the city were scared, and rushed out, uncertain of the event. Virgins, who had been shut up within their chambers, came out with their mothers, scattering dust and ashes on their heads, and filling the streets with outcries. Women who had recently been arrayed for marriage left their bridal chambers, left the reserve that befitted them, and ran around the city in a disorderly manner. New-born babes were deserted by the mothers or nurses who waited upon them—some here, some there, in houses, or in fields; these now, with an ardor which could not be checked, swarmed into the Most High temple. Various prayers were offered up by those who assembled in this place because of the unholy attempt of the king. Along with these there were some of the citizens who took courage and would not submit to his obstinacy and his intention of carrying out his purpose. Calling out to arms, and to die bravely in defense of the law of their fathers, they created a great uproar in the place, and were with difficulty brought back by the aged and the elders to the station of prayer which they had occupied before. During this time, the multitude kept on praying. The elders who surrounded the king tried in many ways to divert his arrogant mind from the design which he had formed. He, in his hardened mood, insensible to all persuasion, was going onward with the view of carrying out this design. Yet even his own officers, when they saw this, joined the Jews in an appeal to Him who has all power to aid in the present crisis, and not wink at such haughty lawlessness. Such was the frequency and the vehemence of the cry of the assembled crowd, that an indescribable noise ensued. Not the men only, but the very walls and floor seemed to sound out, all things preferring death rather than to see the place defiled.

### Chapter 2

Now it was that the high priest Simon bowed his knees near the holy place, spread out his hands in reverent form, and uttered the following prayer: “O Lord, Lord, King of the heavens, and Ruler of the whole creation, Holy among the holy, sole Governor, Almighty, give ear to us who are oppressed by a wicked and profane one, who celebrates in his confidence and strength. It is you, the Creator of all, the Lord of the universe, who are a righteous Governor, and judge all who act with pride and insolence. It was you who destroyed the former workers of unrighteousness, among whom were the giants, who trusted in their strength and daring, by covering them with a measureless flood. It was you who made the Sodomites, those workers of exceedingly iniquity, men notorious for their vices, an example to later generations, when you covered them with fire and brimstone. You made known your power when you caused the bold Pharaoh, the enslaver of your people, to pass through the ordeal of many and diverse inflictions. You rolled the depths of the sea over him when he pursued with chariots and with a multitude of followers, and gave a safe passage to those who put their trust in you, the Lord of the whole creation. These saw and felt the works of your hands, and praised you, the Almighty. You, O King, when you created the immeasurable and measureless earth, chose this city. You made this place sacred to your name, even though you need nothing. You glorified it with your illustrious presence, after constructing it to the glory of your great and honorable name. You promised, out of love for the people of Israel, that if we fall away from you, become afflicted, and then come to this house and pray, you would hear our prayer. Truly you are faithful and true. When you often aided our fathers when hard pressed and humiliated, and delivered them out of great dangers, see now, holy King, how through our many and great sins we are crushed and made subject to our enemies, and have become weak and powerless. In our low condition, this bold and profane man seeks to dishonor this your holy place, consecrated out of the earth to the name of your Majesty. Your dwelling place, the heaven of heavens, is indeed unapproachable to men. But since it seemed good to you to exhibit your glory among your people Israel, you sanctified this place. Don’t punish us by means of the uncleanness of their men, and don’t chastise us by means of their profanity, lest the lawless ones should boast in their rage, and exult in exuberant pride of speech, and say, ‘We have trampled upon the holy house, as idolatrous houses are trampled upon.’ Blot out our iniquities, do away with our errors, and show your compassion in this hour. Let your mercies quickly go before us. Grant us peace, that the downcast and broken hearted may praise you with their mouth.”

At that time God, who sees all things, who is beyond all Holy among the holy, heard that prayer, so suitable, and scourged the man who was greatly uplifted with scorn and insolence. Shaking him back and forth as a reed is shaken with the wind, he threw him down on the pavement, powerless, with limbs paralyzed, and by a righteous judgment deprived of the ability to speak. His friends and bodyguards, seeing the swift recompense which had suddenly overtaken him, struck with exceeding terror, and fearing that he would die, speedily removed him. When in course of time he had come to himself, this severe punishment caused no repentance within him, but he departed with bitter threatenings.

He proceeded to Egypt, grew worse in wickedness through his previously mentioned companions in wine, who were lost to all goodness, and not satisfied with countless acts of impiety, his audacity so increased that he raised evil reports there, and many of his friends, watching his purpose attentively, joined in furthering his will. His purpose was to inflict a public stigma upon our race. Therefore he erected a stone pillar in the courtyard, and caused the following inscription to be engraved upon it: “Entrance to this temple is to be refused to all those who would not sacrifice. All the Jews were to be registered among the slaves. Those who resisted are to be forcibly seized and put to death. Those who are thus registered are to be marked on their persons by the ivy-leaf symbol of Dionysus, and to be reduced to these limited rights.” To do away with the appearance of hating them all, he had it written underneath, that if any of them should elect to enter the community of those initiated in the rites, these should have equal rights with the Alexandrians.

Some of those who were over the city, therefore, abhorring any approach to the city of piety, unhesitatingly gave in to the king, and expected to derive some great honor from a future connection with him. A nobler spirit, however, prompted the majority to cling to their religious observances, and by paying money that they might live unmolested, these sought to escape the registration, cheerfully looking forward to future aid, they abhorred their own apostates, considering them to be national foes, and depriving them of common fellowship and mutual help.

### Chapter 3

On discovering this, so incensed was the wicked king, that he no longer confined his rage to the Jews in Alexandria. Laying his hand more heavily upon those who lived in the country, he gave orders that they should be quickly collected into one place, and most cruelly deprived of their lives. While this was going on, a hostile rumor was uttered abroad by men who had banded together to injure the Jewish race. The pretext of their charge was that the Jews kept them away from the ordinances of the law. Now the Jews always maintained a feeling of unwavering loyalty toward the kings, yet, as they worshiped God and observed his law, they made certain distinctions, and avoided certain things. Hence they appeared hateful to some people, although, as they adorned their conversation with works of righteousness, they had established themselves in the good opinion of the world. What all the rest of mankind said was, however, disregarded by the foreigners, who said much of the exclusiveness of the Jews with regard to their worship and meats. They alleged that they were unsociable men, hostile to the king’s interests, refusing to associate with him or his troops. By this way of speaking, they brought much hatred on them. This unexpected uproar and sudden gathering of people was observed by the Greeks who lived in the city, concerning men who had never harmed them. Yet to aid them was not in their power, since all was oppression around, but they encouraged them in their troubles, and expected a favorable turn of affairs. He who knows all things will not, they said, disregard so great a people. Some of the neighbors, friends, and business associates of the Jews even called them secretly to an interview, pledged them their assistance, and promised to do their very utmost for them.

Now the king, elated with his prosperous fortune, and not regarding the superior power of God, but thinking to persevere in his present purpose, wrote the following letter to the prejudice of the Jews: “King Ptolemy Philopater, to the commanders and soldiers in Egypt, and in all places, health and happiness! I am doing well, and so, too, are my affairs. Since our Asiatic campaign, the particulars of which you know, and which by the aid of the gods, not lightly given, and by our own vigor, has been brought to a successful conclusion according to our expectation, we resolved, not with strength of spear, but with gentleness and much humanity, as it were to nurse the inhabitants of Coele-Syria and Phoenicia, and to be their willing benefactors. So, having bestowed considerable sums of money upon the temples of the several cities, we proceeded even as far as Jerusalem, and went up to honor the temple of these wretched beings who never cease from their folly. To outward appearance they received us willingly, but belied that appearance by their deeds. When we were eager to enter their temple, and to honor it with the most beautiful and exquisite gifts, they were so carried away by their old arrogance as to forbid us the entrance, while we, out of our forbearance toward all men, refrained from exercising our power upon them. Thus, exhibiting their enmity against us, they alone among the nations lift up their heads against kings and benefactors, as men unwilling to submit to any reasonable thing. We then, having endeavored to make allowance for the madness of these people, and on our victorious return treating all people in Egypt courteously, acted in a manner which was befitting. Accordingly, bearing no ill will against their kinsmen, but rather remembering our connection with them, and the numerous matters with sincere heart from a remote period entrusted to them, we wished to venture a total alteration of their state, by giving them the rights of citizens of Alexandria, and to admit them to the everlasting rites of our solemnities. All this, however, they have taken in a very different spirit. With their innate malignity, they have spurned the fair offer, and constantly inclining to evil, have rejected the inestimable rights. Not only so, but by using speech, and by refraining from speech, they abhor the few among them who are heartily disposed toward us, ever deeming that their infamous way of life will force us to do away with our reform. Having then received certain proofs that these Jews bear us every sort of ill will, we must look forward to the possibility of some sudden tumult among ourselves when these impious men may turn traitors and barbarous enemies. Therefore, as soon as the contents of this letter become known to you, in that same hour we order those Jews who dwell among you, with wives and children, to be sent to us, vilified and abused, in chains of iron, to undergo a cruel and shameful death, suitable to enemies. For by the punishment of them in one body we perceive that we have found the only means of establishing our affairs for the future on a firm and satisfactory basis. Whoever protects a Jew, whether it be old man, child, or nursing baby, shall with his whole house be tortured to death. Whoever informs against the Jews, besides receiving the property of the person charged, shall be presented with two thousand drachmas from the royal treasury, shall be made free, and shall be crowned. Whatever place shelters a Jew shall be made unapproachable and shall be put under the ban of fire, and be forever rendered useless to every living being for all time to come.” The king’s letter was written in the above form.

### Chapter 4

Wherever this decree was received, the people kept up a revelry of joy and shouting, as if their long-pent-up, hardened hatred would now show itself openly. The Jews suffered great throes of sorrow and wept much, while their hearts, all things around being lamentable, were set on fire as they bewailed the sudden destruction which was decreed against them. What home, or city, or any inhabited place, or what streets were there, which their condition didn’t fill with wailing and lamentation? They were sent out unanimously by the generals in various cities, with such stern and pitiless feeling that the exceptional nature of the infliction moved even some of their enemies. These, influenced by sentiments of common humanity, and reflecting upon the uncertain issue of life, shed tears at their miserable expulsion. A multitude of aged hoary-haired old men were driven along with halting bending feet, urged onward by the impulse of a violent, shameless force to quick speed. Girls who had entered the bridal chamber quite lately, to enjoy the partnership of marriage, exchanged pleasure for misery; and with dust scattered upon their myrrh-anointed heads, were hurried along unveiled; and, in the midst of outlandish insults, set up with one accord a lamentable cry instead of the marriage hymn. Bound and exposed to public gaze, they were hurried violently on board ship. The husbands of these, in the prime of their youthful vigor, instead of crowns, wore ropes round their necks. Instead of feasting and youthful celebration, they spent the rest of their nuptial days in wailing, and saw only the grave at hand. They were dragged along by unyielding chains, like wild animals. Of these, some had their necks thrust into the benches of the rowers, while the feet of others were enclosed in hard fetters. The planks of the deck above them blocked out the light and shut out the day on every side, so that they might be treated like traitors during the whole voyage.

They were carried like this in this vessel, and at the end of it arrived at Schedia. The king had ordered them to be cast into the vast hippodrome, which was built in front of the city. This place was well adapted by its situation to expose them to the gaze of all comers into the city, and of those who went from the city into the country. Thus they could hold no communication with his forces. They weren’t deemed worthy of any civilized accommodation. When this was done, the king, hearing that their kindred in the city often went out and lamented the melancholy distress of these victims, was full of rage, and commanded that they should be carefully subjected to the same—and not one bit milder—treatment. The whole nation was now to be registered. Every individual was to be specified by name, not for that hard servitude of labor which we have a little before mentioned, but that he might expose them to the before-mentioned tortures; and finally, in the short space of a day, might exterminate them by his cruelties. The registering of these men was carried on cruelly, zealously, assiduously, from the rising of the sun to its going down, and was not brought to an end in forty days. The king was filled with great and constant joy, and celebrated banquets before the temple idols. His erring heart, far from the truth, and his profane mouth gave glory to idols, deaf and incapable of speaking or aiding, and uttered unworthy speech against the Greatest God. At the end of the above-mentioned interval of time, the registrars brought word to the king that the multitude of the Jews was too great for registration, inasmuch as there were many still left in the land, of whom some were in inhabited houses, and others were scattered about in various places, so that all the commanders in Egypt were insufficient for the work. The king threatened them, and charged them with taking bribes, in order to contrive the escape of the Jews, but was clearly convinced of the truth of what had been said. They said, and proved, that paper and pens had failed them for the carrying out of their purpose. Now this was an active interference of the unconquerable Providence which assisted the Jews from heaven.

### Chapter 5

Then he called Hermon, who had charge of the elephants. Full of rage, altogether fixed in his furious design, he commanded him, with a quantity of unmixed wine with handfuls of incense infused, to drug the elephants early on the following day. These five hundred elephants were, when infuriated by the copious drinks of frankincense, to be led up to the execution of death upon the Jews. The king, after issuing these orders, went to his feasting, and gathered together all those of his friends and of the army who hated the Jews the most. The master of the elephants, Hermon, fulfilled his commission punctually. The servants appointed for the purpose went out about evening and bound the hands of the miserable victims, and took other precautions for their security at night, thinking that the whole race would perish together. The heathen believed the Jews to be destitute of all protection, for chains bound them. They invoked the Almighty Lord, and ceaselessly implored with tears their merciful God and Father, Ruler of all, Lord of every power, to overthrow the evil purpose which had gone out against them, and to deliver them by extraordinary manifestation from that death which was in store for them. Their earnest entreaty went up to heaven. Then Hermon, who had filled his merciless elephants with copious drinks of mixed wine and frankincense, came early to the palace to report on these preparations. He, however, who has sent his good creature sleep from all time by night or by day thus gratifying whom he wills, diffused a portion of it now upon the king. By this sweet and profound influence of the Lord, he was held fast, and thus his unjust purpose was quite frustrated, and his unflinching resolve greatly falsified. But the Jews, having escaped the hour which had been fixed, praised their holy God, and again prayed him who is easily reconciled to display the power of his powerful hand to the arrogant Gentiles. The middle of the tenth hour had nearly arrived, when the person who sent invitations, seeing the guests who were invited present, came and shook the king. He gained his attention with difficulty, and hinting that the mealtime was getting past, talked the matter over with him. The king listened to this, and then turning aside to his drinking, commanded the guests to sit down before him. This done, he asked them to enjoy themselves, and to indulge in mirth at this somewhat late hour of the banquet. Conversation grew on, and the king sent for Hermon, and inquired of him, with fierce denunciations, why the Jews had been allowed to outlive that day. Hermon explained that he had done his bidding over night; and in this he was confirmed by his friends. The king, then, with a barbarity exceeding that of Phalaris, said, “They might thank his sleep of that day. Lose no time, and get ready the elephants against tomorrow, as you did before, for the destruction of these accursed Jews.” When the king said this, the company present were glad, and approved. Then each man went to his own home. They didn’t employ the night in sleep, but in contriving cruel mockeries for those deemed miserable. The morning cock had just crowed, and Hermon, having harnessed the brutes, was stimulating them in the great colonnade. The city crowds were collected together to see the hideous spectacle, and waited impatiently for the dawn. The Jews, breathless with momentary suspense, stretched out their hands and prayed the Greatest God, in mournful strains, again to help them speedily. The sun’s rays were not yet shining and the king was waiting for his friends when Hermon came to him, calling him out, and saying that his desires could now be realized. The king, receiving him, was astonished at his unusual invitation. Overwhelmed with a spirit of oblivion about everything, inquired about the object of this earnest preparation. But this was the working of that Almighty God who had made him forget all his purpose. Hermon and all his friends pointed out the preparation of the animals. They are ready, O king, according to your own strict injunction. The king was filled with fierce anger at these words, for, by the Providence of God regarding these things, his mind had become entirely confused. He looked hard at Hermon, and threatened him as follows: “Your parents, or your children, were they here, would have given a large meal to these wild animals, not these innocent Jews, who have loyally served me and my forefathers. Had it not been for familiar friendship, and the claims of your office, your life should have gone for theirs.”

Hermon, being threatened in this unexpected and alarming manner, was troubled in his eyes, and his face fell. The friends, too, stole out one by one, and dismissed the assembled multitudes to their respective occupations. The Jews, having heard of these events, praised the glorious God and King of kings, because they had obtained this help, too, from him. Now the king arranged another banquet in the same way, and proclaimed an invitation to mirth. He summoned Hermon to his presence, and said, with threats, “How often, O wretch, must I repeat my orders to you about these same persons? Once more, arm the elephants for the extermination of the Jews tomorrow!” His kinsmen, who were reclining with him, wondered at his instability, and thus expressed themselves: “O king, how long do you test us, as of men bereft of reason? This is the third time that you have ordered their destruction. When the thing is to be done, you change your mind, and recall your instructions. Because of this, the feeling of expectation causes tumult in the city. It swarms with factions, and is continually on the point of being plundered.”

The king, just like another Phalaris, a prey to thoughtlessness, made no account of the changes which his own mind had undergone, issuing in the deliverance of the Jews. He swore a fruitless oath, and determined immediately to send them to hades, crushed by the knees and feet of the elephants. He would also invade Judea, level its towns with fire and the sword, destroy that temple which the heathen might not enter, and prevent sacrifices ever after being offered up there. Joyfully his friends broke up, together with his kinsmen; and, trusting in his determination, arranged their forces in guard at the most convenient places of the city. The master of the elephants urged the animals into an almost maniacal state, drenched them with incense and wine, and decked them with frightful devices. About early morning, when the city was filled with an immense number of people at the hippodrome, he entered the palace and called the king to the business in hand. The king’s heart teemed with impious rage; and he rushed forth with the mass, along with the elephants. With unsoftened feelings and pitiless eyes, he longed to gaze at the hard and wretched doom of the previously mentioned Jews. But the Jews, when the elephants went out at the gate, followed by the armed force. When they saw the dust raised by the throng, and heard the loud cries of the crowd, thought that they had come to the last moment of their lives, to the end of what they had tremblingly expected. They gave way, therefore, to lamentations and moans. They kissed each other. Those nearest of kin to each other hung around one another’s necks—fathers hugging their sons and mothers their daughters. Other women held their infants to their breasts, which drew what seemed their last milk. Nevertheless, when they reflected upon the help previously granted them from heaven, they prostrated themselves with one accord, removed even the sucking children from the breasts, and sent up an exceedingly great cry asking the Lord of all power to reveal himself, and have mercy upon those who now lay at the gates of hades.

### Chapter 6

Then Eleazar, an illustrious priest of the country, who had attained to length of days, and whose life had been adorned with virtue, caused the elders who were around him to cease to cry out to the holy God, and prayed this: “O king, mighty in power, most high, Almighty God, who regulates the whole creation with your tender mercy, look at the seed of Abraham, at the children of the sanctified Jacob, your sanctified inheritance, O Father, now being wrongfully destroyed as foreigners in a foreign land. You destroyed Pharaoh with his army of chariots when that lord of this same Egypt was uplifted with lawless daring and loud-sounding tongue. Shedding the beams of your mercy upon the race of Israel, you overwhelmed him and his proud army. When Sennacherim, the grievous king of the Assyrians, exulting in his countless army, had subdued the whole land with his spear and was lifting himself against your holy city with boastings grievous to be endured, you, O Lord, demolished him and displayed your might to many nations. When the three friends in the land of Babylon of their own will exposed their lives to the fire rather than serve vain things, you sent a moist coolness through the fiery furnace, and brought the fire on all their adversaries. It was you who, when Daniel was hurled, through slander and envy, as a prey to lions down below, brought him back again unharmed to light. When Jonah was pining away in the belly of the sea-born monster, you looked at him, O Father, and recovered him to the sight of his own. Now, you who hate insolence, you who abound in mercy, you who are the protector of all things, appear quickly to those of the race of Israel, who are insulted by abhorred, lawless gentiles. If our life during our exile has been stained with iniquity, deliver us from the hand of the enemy, and destroy us, O Lord, by the death which you prefer. Don’t let the vain-minded congratulate vain idols at the destruction of your beloved, saying, ‘Their god didn’t deliver them.’ You who are All-powerful and Almighty, O Eternal One, behold! Have mercy on us who are being withdrawn from life, like traitors, by the unreasoning insolence of lawless men. Let the heathen cower before your invincible might today, O glorious One, who have all power to save the race of Jacob. The whole band of infants and their parents ask you with tears. Let it be shown to all the nations that you are with us, O Lord, and have not turned your face away from us, but as you said that you would not forget them even in the land of their enemies, so fulfill this saying, O Lord.”

Now, at the time that Eleazar had ended his prayer, the king came along to the hippodrome with the wild animals, and with his tumultuous power. When the Jews saw this, they uttered a loud cry to heaven so that the adjacent valleys resounded and caused an irrepressible lamentation throughout the army. Then the all-glorious, all-powerful, and true God, displayed his holy countenance, and opened the gates of heaven, from which two angels, dreadful of form, came down and were visible to all but the Jews. They stood opposite, and filled the enemies’ army with confusion and cowardice, and bound them with immoveable shackles. A cold shudder came over the person of the king, and oblivion paralyzed the vehemence of his spirit. They turned back the animals on the armed forces who followed them; and the animals trampled them and destroyed them. The king’s wrath was converted into compassion; and he wept at the things he had devised. For when he heard the cry, and saw them all on the verge of destruction, with tears he angrily threatened his friends, saying, “You have governed badly, and have exceeded tyrants in cruelty. You have labored to deprive me, your benefactor, at once of my dominion and my life, by secretly devising measures injurious to the kingdom. Who has gathered here, unreasonably removing each from his home, those who, in fidelity to us, had held the fortresses of the country? Who has consigned to unmerited punishments those who in good will toward us from the beginning have in all things surpassed all nations, and who often have engaged in the most dangerous undertakings? Loose, loose the unjust bonds! Send them to their homes in peace, begging pardon for what has been done. Release the sons of the almighty living God of heaven, who from our ancestors’ times until now has granted a glorious and uninterrupted prosperity to our affairs.” He said these things, and they, released the same moment, having now escaped death, praised God their holy Savior.

The king then departed to the city, and called his financier to himself, and asked him provide a seven days’ quantity of wine and other materials for feasting for the Jews. He decided that they should keep a cheerful festival of deliverance in the very place in which they expected to meet with their destruction. Then they who were before despised and near to hades, yes, rather advanced into it, partook of the cup of salvation, instead of a grievous and lamentable death. Full of exultation, they apportioned the place intended for their fall and burial into banqueting booths. Ceasing their miserable strain of woe, they took up the subject of their fatherland, singing in praise to God their wonder-working Savior. All groans and all wailing were laid aside. They formed dances as a sign of peaceful joy. So the king also collected a number of guests for the occasion, and returned unceasing thanks with much magnificence for the unexpected deliverance afforded him. Those who had marked them out as for death and for carrion, and had registered them with joy, howled aloud, and were clothed with shame, and had the fire of their rage ingloriously put out. But the Jews, as we just said, instituted a dance, and then gave themselves up to feasting, glad thanksgiving, and psalms. They made a public ordinance to commemorate these things for generations to come, as long as they should be sojourners. They thus established these days as days of mirth, not for the purpose of drinking or luxury, but because God had saved them. They requested the king to send them back to their homes. They were being enrolled from the twenty-fifth of Pachon to the fourth of Epiphi, a period of forty days. The measures taken for their destruction lasted from the fifth of Epiphi till the seventh, that is, three days. The Ruler over all during this time manifested his mercy gloriously, and delivered them all together unharmed. They feasted upon the king’s provision up to the fourteenth day, then asked to be sent away. The king commended them, and wrote the following letter, of magnanimous import for them, to the commanders of every city:

### Chapter 7

“King Ptolemy Philopator to the commanders throughout Egypt, and to all who are set over affairs, joy and strength. We, too, and our children are well. God has directed our affairs as we wish. Certain of our friends out of malice vehemently urged us to punish the Jews of our realm in a body, with the infliction of a monstrous punishment. They pretended that our affairs would never be in a good state till this took place. Such, they said, was the hatred borne by the Jews to all other people. They brought them fettered in grievous chains as slaves, no, as traitors. Without enquiry or examination they endeavored to annihilate them. They buckled themselves with a savage cruelty, worse than Scythian custom. For this cause we severely threatened them; yet, with the clemency which we usually extend to all men, we at length permitted them to live. Finding that the God of heaven cast a shield of protection over the Jews so as to preserve them, and that he fought for them as a father always fights for his sons, and taking into consideration their constancy and fidelity toward us and toward our ancestors, we have, as we ought, acquitted them of every sort of charge. We have dismissed them to their several homes, telling all men everywhere to do them no wrong, or unrighteously revile them about the past. For know this, that should we conceive any evil design, or in any way aggrieve them, we shall ever have as our adversary, not man, but the highest God, the ruler of all might. From Him there will be no escape, as the avenger of such deeds. Farewell.”

When they had received this letter, they didn’t hurry to depart immediately. They petitioned the king to be allowed to inflict fitting punishment upon those of their race who had willingly transgressed the holy god, and the law of God. They alleged that men who had for their bellies’ sake transgressed the ordinances of God, would never be faithful to the interests of the king. The king admitted the truth of this reasoning, and commended them. Full power was given them, without warrant or special commission, to destroy those who had transgressed the law of God boldly in every part of the king’s dominions. Their priests, then, as it was appropriate, saluted him with good wishes, and all the people echoed with the “Hallelujah!” Then they joyfully departed. Then they punished and shamefully destroyed every polluted Jew that fell in their way, slaying this way, in that day, more than three hundred men, and esteeming this destruction of the wicked a season of joy. They themselves having held closely to their God to death, and having enjoyed a full deliverance, departed from the city garlanded with sweet-flowered wreaths of every kind. Uttering exclamations of joy, with songs of praise, and melodious hymns, they thanked the God of their fathers, the eternal Savior of Israel. Having arrived at Ptolemais, called from the specialty of that district “Rose-bearing”, where the fleet, in accordance with the general wish, waited for them seven days, they partook of a banquet of deliverance, for the king generously granted them all the means of securing a return home. They were accordingly brought back in peace, while they gave utterance to appropriate thanks; and they determined to observe these days during their sojourn as days of joyfulness. These they registered as sacred upon a pillar, when they had dedicated the place of their festivity to be one of prayer. They departed unharmed, free, abundant in joy, preserved by the king’s command, by land, by sea, and by river, each to his own home. They had more weight than before among their enemies, and were honored and feared. No one in any way robbed them of their goods. Every man received back his own, according to inventory, those who had obtained their goods, giving them up with the greatest terror. For the greatest God made perfect wonders for their salvation. Blessed be the Redeemer of Israel forever! Amen.

## 2 Esdras

The Second Book of Esdras is included in the Slavonic Bible as 3 Esdras, but is not found in the Greek Septuagint. It is included in the Appendix to the Latin Vulgate Bible as 4 Esdras. It is considered to be Apocrypha by most church traditions. It is preserved here for its supplementary historical value.

### Chapter 1

The second book of the prophet Esdras, the son of Saraias, the son of Azaraias, the son of Helkias, the son of Salemas, the son of Sadoc, the son of Ahitob, the son of Achias, the son of Phinees, the son of Heli, the son of Amarias, the son of Aziei, the son of Marimoth, the son of Arna, the son of Ozias, the son of Borith, the son of Abissei, the son of Phinees, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, of the tribe of Levi, who was captive in the land of the Medes, in the reign of Artaxerxes king of the Persians.

The Lord’s word came to me, saying, “Go your way and show my people their sinful deeds, and their children their wickedness which they have done against me, that they may tell their children’s children, because the sins of their fathers have increased in them, for they have forgotten me, and have offered sacrifices to foreign gods. Didn’t I bring them out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage? But they have provoked me to wrath and have despised my counsels. So pull out the hair of your head and cast all evils upon them, for they have not been obedient to my law, but they are a rebellious people. How long shall I endure them, to whom I have done so much good? I have overthrown many kings for their sakes. I have struck down Pharoah with his servants and all his army. I have destroyed all the nations before them. In the east, I have scattered the people of two provinces, even of Tyre and Sidon, and have slain all their adversaries. Speak therefore to them, saying:

“The Lord says, truly I brought you through the sea, and where there was no path I made highways for you. I gave you Moses for a leader and Aaron for a priest. I gave you light in a pillar of fire. I have done great wonders among you, yet you have forgotten me, says the Lord.

“The Lord Almighty says: The quails were for a token to you. I gave you a camp for your protection, but you complained there. You didn’t celebrate in my name for the destruction of your enemies, but even to this day you still complain. Where are the benefits that I have given you? When you were hungry and thirsty in the wilderness, didn’t you cry to me, saying, ‘Why have you brought us into this wilderness to kill us? It would have been better for us to have served the Egyptians than to die in this wilderness.’ I had pity on your mourning and gave you manna for food. You ate angels’ bread. When you were thirsty, didn’t I split the rock, and water flowed out in abundance? Because of the heat, I covered you with the leaves of the trees. I divided fruitful lands among you. I drove out the Canaanites, the Pherezites, and the Philistines before you. What more shall I do for you?” says the Lord.

The Lord Almighty says, “When you were in the wilderness, at the bitter stream, being thirsty and blaspheming my name, I gave you not fire for your blasphemies, but threw a tree in the water, and made the river sweet. What shall I do to you, O Jacob? You, Judah, would not obey me. I will turn myself to other nations, and I will give my name to them, that they may keep my statutes. Since you have forsaken me, I also will forsake you. When you ask me to be merciful to you, I will have no mercy upon you. Whenever you call upon me, I will not hear you, for you have defiled your hands with blood, and your feet are swift to commit murder. It is not as though you have forsaken me, but your own selves,” says the Lord.

The Lord Almighty says, “Haven’t I asked you as a father his sons, as a mother her daughters, and a nurse her young babies, that you would be my people, and I would be your God, that you would be my children, and I would be your father? I gathered you together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings. But now, what should I do to you? I will cast you out from my presence. When you offer burnt sacrifices to me, I will turn my face from you, for I have rejected your solemn feast days, your new moons, and your circumcisions of the flesh. I sent to you my servants the prophets, whom you have taken and slain, and torn their bodies in pieces, whose blood I will require from you,” says the Lord.

The Lord Almighty says, “Your house is desolate. I will cast you out as the wind blows stubble. Your children won’t be fruitful, for they have neglected my commandment to you, and done that which is evil before me. I will give your houses to a people that will come, which not having heard of me yet believe me. Those to whom I have shown no signs will do what I have commanded. They have seen no prophets, yet they will remember their former condition. I call to witness the gratitude of the people who will come, whose little ones rejoice with gladness. Although they see me not with bodily eyes, yet in spirit they will believe what I say.”

And now, father, behold with glory, and see the people that come from the east: to whom I will give for leaders, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, Oseas, Amos, and Micheas, Joel, Abdias, and Jonas, Nahum, and Abacuc, Sophonias, Aggaeus, Zachary, and Malachy, who is also called the Lord’s messenger.

### Chapter 2

The Lord says, “I brought this people out of bondage. I gave them my commandments by my servants the prophets, whom they would not listen to, but made my counsels void. The mother who bore them says to them, ‘Go your way, my children, for I am a widow and forsaken. I brought you up with gladness, and I have lost you with sorrow and heaviness, for you have sinned before the Lord God, and done that which is evil before me. But now what can I do for you? For I am a widow and forsaken. Go your way, my children, and ask for mercy from the Lord.’ As for me, O father, I call upon you for a witness in addition to the mother of these children, because they would not keep my covenant, that you may bring them to confusion, and their mother to ruin, that they may have no offspring. Let them be scattered abroad among the heathen. Let their names be blotted out of the earth, for they have despised my covenant. Woe to you, Assur, you who hide the unrighteous with you! You wicked nation, remember what I did to Sodom and Gomorrah, whose land lies in lumps of pitch and heaps of ashes. That is what I will also do to those who have not listened to me,” says the Lord Almighty.

The Lord says to Esdras, “Tell my people that I will give them the kingdom of Jerusalem, which I would have given to Israel. I will also take their glory back to myself, and give these the everlasting tabernacles which I had prepared for them. They will have the tree of life for fragrant perfume. They will neither labor nor be weary. Ask, and you will receive. Pray that your days may be few, that they may be shortened. The kingdom is already prepared for you. Watch! Call heaven and earth to witness. Call them to witness, for I have left out evil, and created the good, for I live, says the Lord.

“Mother, embrace your children. I will bring them out with gladness like a dove does. Establish their feet, for I have chosen you, says the Lord. I will raise those who are dead up again from their places, and bring them out from their tombs, for I recognize my name in them. Don’t be afraid, you mother of children, for I have chosen you, says the Lord. For your help, I will send my servants Esaias and Jeremy, after whose counsel I have sanctified and prepared for you twelve trees laden with various fruits, and as many springs flowing with milk and honey, and seven mighty mountains, on which roses and lilies grow, with which I will fill your children with joy. Do right to the widow. Secure justice for the fatherless. Give to the poor. Defend the orphan. Clothe the naked. Heal the broken and the weak. Don’t laugh a lame man to scorn. Defend the maimed. Let the blind man have a vision of my glory. Protect the old and young within your walls. Wherever you find the dead, set a sign upon them and commit them to the grave, and I will give you the first place in my resurrection. Stay still, my people, and take your rest, for your rest will come. Nourish your children, good nurse, and establish their feet. As for the servants whom I have given you, not one of them will perish, for I will require them from among your number. Don’t be anxious, for when the day of suffering and anguish comes, others will weep and be sorrowful, but you will rejoice and have abundance. The nations will envy you, but they will be able to do nothing against you, says the Lord. My hands will cover you, so that your children don’t see Gehenna. Be joyful, mother, with your children, for I will deliver you, says the Lord. Remember your children who sleep, for I will bring them out of the secret places of the earth and show mercy to them, for I am merciful, says the Lord Almighty. Embrace your children until I come, and proclaim mercy to them, for my wells run over, and my grace won’t fail.”

I, Esdras, received a command from the Lord on Mount Horeb to go to Israel, but when I came to them, they rejected me and rejected the Lord’s commandment. Therefore I say to you, O nations that hear and understand, “Look for your shepherd. He will give you everlasting rest, for he is near at hand who will come at the end of the age. Be ready for the rewards of the kingdom, for the everlasting light will shine on you forevermore. Flee the shadow of this world, receive the joy of your glory. I call to witness my savior openly. Receive that which is given to you by the Lord, and be joyful, giving thanks to him who has called you to heavenly kingdoms. Arise and stand up, and see the number of those who have been sealed at the Lord’s feast. Those who withdrew themselves from the shadow of the world have received glorious garments from the Lord. Take again your full number, O Zion, and make up the reckoning of those of yours who are clothed in white, which have fulfilled the law of the Lord. The number of your children, whom you long for, is fulfilled. Ask the power of the Lord, that your people, which have been called from the beginning, may be made holy.”

I, Esdras, saw upon Mount Zion a great multitude, whom I could not number, and they all praised the Lord with songs. In the midst of them, there was a young man of a high stature, taller than all the rest, and upon every one of their heads he set crowns, and he was more exalted than they were. I marveled greatly at this. So I asked the angel, and said, “What are these, my Lord?”

He answered and said to me, “These are those who have put off the mortal clothing, and put on the immortal, and have confessed the name of God. Now are they crowned, and receive palms.”

Then said I to the angel, “Who is the young man who sets crowns on them, and gives them palms in their hands?”

So he answered and said to me, “He is the Son of God, whom they have confessed in the world.”

Then I began to praise those who stood so valiantly for the name of the Lord.

Then the angel said to me, “Go your way, and tell my people what kind of things, and how great wonders of the Lord God you have seen.”

### Chapter 3

In the thirtieth year after the ruin of the city, I Salathiel, also called Esdras, was in Babylon, and lay troubled upon my bed, and my thoughts came up over my heart, for I saw the desolation of Zion and the wealth of those who lived at Babylon. My spirit was very agitated, so that I began to speak words full of fear to the Most High, and said, “O sovereign Lord, didn’t you speak at the beginning when you formed the earth—and that yourself alone—and commanded the dust and it gave you Adam, a body without a soul? Yet it was the workmanship of your hands, and you breathed into him the breath of life, and he was made alive in your presence. You led him into the garden which your right hand planted before the earth appeared. You gave him your one commandment, which he transgressed, and immediately you appointed death for him and his descendants. From him were born nations, tribes, peoples, and kindred without number. Every nation walked after their own will, did ungodly things in your sight, and despised your commandments, and you didn’t hinder them. Nevertheless, again in process of time, you brought the flood on those who lived in the world and destroyed them. It came to pass that the same thing happened to them. Just as death came to Adam, so was the flood to these. Nevertheless, you left one of them, Noah with his household, and all the righteous men who descended from him.

“It came to pass that when those who lived upon the earth began to multiply, they also multiplied children, peoples, and many nations, and began again to be more ungodly than their ancestors. It came to pass, when they did wickedly before you, you chose one from among them, whose name was Abraham. You loved, and to him only you showed the end of the times secretly by night, and made an everlasting covenant with him, promising him that you would never forsake his descendants. To him, you gave Isaac, and to Isaac you gave Jacob and Esau. You set apart Jacob for yourself, but rejected Esau. Jacob became a great multitude. It came to pass that when you led his descendants out of Egypt, you brought them up to Mount Sinai. You bowed the heavens also, shook the earth, moved the whole world, made the depths tremble, and troubled the age. Your glory went through four gates, of fire, of earthquake, of wind, and of ice, that you might give the law to the descendants of Jacob, and the commandment to the descendants of Israel.

“Yet you didn’t take away from them their wicked heart, that your law might produce fruit in them. For the first Adam, burdened with a wicked heart transgressed and was overcome, as were all who are descended from him. Thus disease was made permanent. The law was in the heart of the people along with the wickedness of the root. So the good departed away and that which was wicked remained. So the times passed away, and the years were brought to an end. Then you raised up a servant, called David, whom you commanded to build a city to your name, and to offer burnt offerings to you in it from what is yours. When this was done many years, then those who inhabited the city did evil, in all things doing as Adam and all his generations had done, for they also had a wicked heart. So you gave your city over into the hands of your enemies.

“Then I said in my heart, ‘Are their deeds of those who inhabit Babylon any better? Is that why it gained dominion over Zion?’ For it came to pass when I came here, that I also saw impieties without number, and my soul saw many sinners in this thirtieth year, so that my heart failed me. For I have seen how you endure them sinning, and have spared those who act ungodly, and have destroyed your people, and have preserved your enemies; and you have not shown how your way may be comprehended. Are the deeds of Babylon better than those of Zion? Or is there any other nation that knows you beside Israel? Or what tribes have so believed your covenants as these tribes of Jacob? Yet their reward doesn’t appear, and their labor has no fruit, for I have gone here and there through the nations, and I see that they abound in wealth, and don’t think about your commandments. Weigh therefore our iniquities now in the balance, and theirs also who dwell in the world, and so will it be found which way the scale inclines. Or when was it that they who dwell on the earth have not sinned in your sight? Or what nation has kept your commandments so well? You will find some men by name who have kept your precepts, but you won’t find nations.”

### Chapter 4

The angel who was sent to me, whose name was Uriel, gave me an answer, and said to me, “Your understanding has utterly failed you regarding this world. Do you think you can comprehend the way of the Most High?”

Then I said, “Yes, my Lord.”

He answered me, “I have been sent to show you three ways, and to set before you three problems. If you can solve one for me, I also will show you the way that you desire to see, and I will teach you why the heart is wicked.”

I said, “Say on, my Lord.”

Then said he to me, “Go, weigh for me the weight of fire, or measure for me blast of wind, or call back for me the day that is past.”

Then answered I and said, “Who of the sons of men is able to do this, that you should ask me about such things?”

He said to me, “If I had asked you, ‘How many dwellings are there in the heart of the sea? Or how many springs are there at the fountain head of the deep? Or how many streams are above the firmament? Or which are the exits of hell? Or which are the entrances of paradise?’ perhaps you would say to me, ‘I never went down into the deep, or as yet into hell, neither did I ever climb up into heaven.’ Nevertheless now I have only asked you about the fire, wind, and the day, things which you have experienced, and from which you can’t be separated, and yet have you given me no answer about them.”

He said moreover to me, “You can’t understand your own things that you grew up with. How then can your mind comprehend the way of the Most High? How can he who is already worn out with the corrupted world understand incorruption?”

When I heard these things, I fell on my face and said to him, “It would have been better if we weren’t here at all, than that we should come here and live in the midst of ungodliness, and suffer, and not know why.”

He answered me, and said, “A forest of the trees of the field went out, and took counsel together, and said, ‘Come! Let’s go and make war against the sea, that it may depart away before us, and that we may make ourselves more forests.’ The waves of the sea also in like manner took counsel together, and said, ‘Come! Let’s go up and subdue the forest of the plain, that there also we may gain more territory.’ The counsel of the wood was in vain, for the fire came and consumed it. Likewise also the counsel of the waves of the sea, for the sand stood up and stopped them. If you were judge now between these two, which would you justify, or which would you condemn?”

I answered and said, “It is a foolish counsel that they both have taken, for the ground is given to the wood, and the place of the sea is given to bear its waves.”

Then answered he me, and said, “You have given a right judgment. Why don’t you judge your own case? For just as the ground is given to the wood, and the sea to its waves, even so those who dwell upon the earth may understand nothing but what is upon the earth. Only he who dwells above the heavens understands the things that are above the height of the heavens.”

Then answered I and said, “I beg you, O Lord, why has the power of understanding been given to me? For it was not in my mind to be curious of the ways above, but of such things as pass by us daily, because Israel is given up as a reproach to the heathen. The people whom you have loved have been given over to ungodly nations. The law of our forefathers is made of no effect, and the written covenants are nowhere regarded. We pass away out of the world like locusts. Our life is like a vapor, and we aren’t worthy to obtain mercy. What will he then do for his name by which we are called? I have asked about these things.”

Then he answered me, and said, “If you are alive you will see, and if you live long, you will marvel, for the world hastens quickly to pass away. For it is not able to bear the things that are promised to the righteous in the times to come; for this world is full of sadness and infirmities. For the evil about which you asked me has been sown, but its harvest hasn’t yet come. If therefore that which is sown isn’t reaped, and if the place where the evil is sown doesn’t pass away, the field where the good is sown won’t come. For a grain of evil seed was sown in the heart of Adam from the beginning, and how much wickedness it has produced to this time! How much more it will yet produce until the time of threshing comes! Ponder now by yourself, how much fruit of wickedness a grain of evil seed has produced. When the grains which are without number are sown, how great a threshing floor they will fill!”

Then I answered and said, “How long? When will these things come to pass? Why are our years few and evil?”

He answered me, and said, “Don’t hurry faster than the Most High; for your haste is for your own self, but he who is above hurries on behalf of many. Didn’t the souls of the righteous ask question of these things in their chambers, saying, ‘How long will we be here? When does the fruit of the threshing floor come?’ To them, Jeremiel the archangel answered, ‘When the number is fulfilled of those who are like you. For he has weighed the world in the balance. By measure, he has measured the times. By number, he has counted the seasons. He won’t move or stir them until that measure is fulfilled.’”

Then I answered, “O sovereign Lord, all of us are full of ungodliness. Perhaps it is for our sakes that the threshing time of the righteous is kept back—because of the sins of those who dwell on the earth.”

So he answered me, “Go your way to a woman with child, and ask of her when she has fulfilled her nine months, if her womb may keep the baby any longer within her.”

Then I said, “No, Lord, that can it not.”

He said to me, “In Hades, the chambers of souls are like the womb. For just like a woman in labor hurries to escape the anguish of the labor pains, even so these places hurry to deliver those things that are committed to them from the beginning. Then you will be shown those things which you desire to see.”

Then I answered, “If I have found favor in your sight, and if it is possible, and if I am worthy, show me this also, whether there is more to come than is past, or whether the greater part has gone over us. For what is gone I know, but I don’t know what is to come.”

He said to me, “Stand up on my right side, and I will explain the parable to you.”

So I stood, looked, and saw a hot burning oven passed by before me. It happened that when the flame had gone by I looked, and saw that the smoke remained. After this, a watery cloud passed in front of me, and sent down much rain with a storm. When the stormy rain was past, the drops still remained in it.”

Then said he to me, “Consider with yourself; as the rain is more than the drops, and the fire is greater than the smoke, so the quantity which is past was far greater; but the drops and the smoke still remained.”

Then I prayed, and said, “Do you think that I will live until that time? Or who will be alive in those days?”

He answered me, “As for the signs you asked me about, I may tell you of them in part; but I wasn’t sent to tell you about your life, for I don’t know.

### Chapter 5

“Nevertheless, concerning the signs, behold, the days will come when those who dwell on earth will be taken with great amazement, and the way of truth will be hidden, and the land will be barren of faith. Iniquity will be increased above what now you see, and beyond what you have heard long ago. The land that you now see ruling will be a trackless waste, and men will see it desolate. But if the Most High grants you to live, you will see what is after the third period will be troubled. The sun will suddenly shine in the night, and the moon in the day. Blood will drop out of wood, and the stone will utter its voice. The peoples will be troubled, and the stars will fall. He will rule whom those who dwell on the earth don’t expect, and the birds will fly away together. The Sodomite sea will cast out fish, and make a noise in the night, which many have not known; but all will hear its voice. There will also be chaos in many places. Fires will break out often, and the wild animals will change their places, and women will bring forth monsters. Salt waters will be found in the sweet, and all friends will destroy one another. Then reason will hide itself, and understanding withdraw itself into its chamber. It will be sought by many, and won’t be found. Unrighteousness and lack of restraint will be multiplied on earth. One country will ask another, ‘Has righteousness, or a man that does righteousness, gone through you?’ And it will say, ‘No.’ It will come to pass at that time that men will hope, but won’t obtain. They will labor, but their ways won’t prosper. I am permitted to show you such signs. If you will pray again, and weep as now, and fast seven days, you will hear yet greater things than these.”

Then I woke up, and an extreme trembling went through my body, and my mind was so troubled that it fainted. So the angel who had come to talk with me held me, comforted me, and set me on my feet.

In the second night, it came to pass that Phaltiel the captain of the people came to me, saying, “Where have you been? Why is your face sad? Or don’t you know that Israel is committed to you in the land of their captivity? Get up then, and eat some bread, and don’t forsake us, like a shepherd who leaves the flock in the power of cruel wolves.”

Then said I to him, “Go away from me and don’t come near me for seven days, and then you shall come to me.” He heard what I said and left me.

So I fasted seven days, mourning and weeping, like Uriel the angel had commanded me. After seven days, the thoughts of my heart were very grievous to me again, and my soul recovered the spirit of understanding, and I began to speak words before the Most High again. I said, “O sovereign Lord of all the woods of the earth, and of all the trees thereof, you have chosen one vine for yourself. Of all the lands of the world you have chosen one country for yourself. Of all the flowers of the world, you have chosen one lily for yourself. Of all the depths of the sea, you have filled one river for yourself. Of all built cities, you have consecrated Zion for yourself. Of all the birds that are created you have named for yourself one dove. Of all the livestock that have been made, you have provided for yourself one sheep. Among all the multitudes of peoples you have gotten yourself one people. To this people, whom you loved, you gave a law that is approved by all. Now, O Lord, why have you given this one people over to many, and have dishonored the one root above others, and have scattered your only one among many? Those who opposed your promises have trampled down those who believed your covenants. If you really do hate your people so much, they should be punished with your own hands.”

Now when I had spoken these words, the angel that came to me the night before was sent to me, and said to me, “Hear me, and I will instruct you. Listen to me, and I will tell you more.”

I said, “Speak on, my Lord.”

Then said he to me, “You are very troubled in mind for Israel’s sake. Do you love that people more than he who made them?”

I said, “No, Lord; but I have spoken out of grief; for my heart is in agony every hour while I labor to comprehend the way of the Most High, and to seek out part of his judgment.”

He said to me, “You can’t.”

And I said, “Why, Lord? Why was I born? Why wasn’t my mother’s womb my grave, that I might not have seen the travail of Jacob, and the wearisome toil of the people of Israel?”

He said to me, “Count for me those who haven’t yet come. Gather together for me the drops that are scattered abroad, and make the withered flowers green again for me. Open for me the chambers that are closed, and bring out the winds for me that are shut up in them. Or show me the image of a voice. Then I will declare to you the travail that you asked to see.”

And I said, “O sovereign Lord, who may know these things except he who doesn’t have his dwelling with men? As for me, I lack wisdom. How can I then speak of these things you asked me about?”

Then said he to me, “Just as you can do none of these things that I have spoken of, even so you can’t find out my judgment, or the end of the love that I have promised to my people.”

I said, “But, behold, O Lord, you have made the promise to those who are alive at the end. What should they do who have been before us, or we ourselves, or those who will come after us?”

He said to me, “I will compare my judgment to a ring. Just as there is no slowness of those who are last, even so there is no swiftness of those who be first.”

So I answered, “Couldn’t you make them all at once that have been made, and that are now, and that are yet to come, that you might show your judgment sooner?”

Then he answered me, “The creature may not move faster than the creator, nor can the world hold them at once who will be created in it.”

And I said, “How have you said to your servant, that you will surely make alive at once the creature that you have created? If therefore they will be alive at once, and the creation will sustain them, even so it might now also support them to be present at once.”

And he said to me, “Ask the womb of a woman, and say to her, ‘If you bear ten children, why do you it at different times? Ask her therefore to give birth to ten children at once.”

I said, “She can’t, but must do it each in their own time.”

Then said he to me, “Even so, I have given the womb of the earth to those who are sown in it in their own times. For just as a young child may not give birth, neither she who has grown old any more, even so have I organized the world which I created.”

I asked, “Seeing that you have now shown me the way, I will speak before you. Is our mother, of whom you have told me, still young? Or does she now draw near to old age?”

He answered me, “Ask a woman who bears children, and she will tell you. Say to her, ‘Why aren’t they whom you have now brought forth like those who were before, but smaller in stature?’ She also will answer you, ‘Those who are born in the strength of youth are different from those who are born in the time of old age, when the womb fails.’ Consider therefore you also, how you are shorter than those who were before you. So are those who come after you smaller than you, as born of the creature which now begins to be old, and is past the strength of youth.”

Then I said, “Lord, I implore you, if I have found favor in your sight, show your servant by whom you visit your creation.”

### Chapter 6

He said to me, “In the beginning, when the earth was made, before the portals of the world were fixed and before the gatherings of the winds blew, before the voices of the thunder sounded and before the flashes of the lightning shone, before the foundations of paradise were laid, before the fair flowers were seen, before the powers of the earthquake were established, before the innumerable army of angels were gathered together, before the heights of the air were lifted up, before the measures of the firmament were named, before the footstool of Zion was established, before the present years were reckoned, before the imaginations of those who now sin were estranged, and before they were sealed who have gathered faith for a treasure— then I considered these things, and they all were made through me alone, and not through another; just as by me also they will be ended, and not by another.”

Then I answered, “What will be the dividing of the times? Or when will be the end of the first and the beginning of the age that follows?”

He said to me, “From Abraham to Isaac, because Jacob and Esau were born to him, for Jacob’s hand held Esau’s heel from the beginning. For Esau is the end of this age, and Jacob is the beginning of the one that follows. The beginning of a man is his hand, and the end of a man is his heel. Seek nothing else between the heel and the hand, Esdras!”

Then I answered, “O sovereign Lord, if I have found favor in your sight, I beg you, show your servant the end of your signs which you showed me part on a previous night.”

So he answered, “Stand up upon your feet, and you will hear a mighty sounding voice. If the place you stand on is greatly moved when it speaks don’t be afraid, for the word is of the end, and the foundations of the earth will understand that the speech is about them. They will tremble and be moved, for they know that their end must be changed.”

It happened that when I had heard it, I stood up on my feet, and listened, and, behold, there was a voice that spoke, and its sound was like the sound of many waters. It said, “Behold, the days come when I draw near to visit those who dwell upon the earth, and when I investigate those who have caused harm unjustly with their unrighteousness, and when the affliction of Zion is complete, and when the seal will be set on the age that is to pass away, then I will show these signs: the books will be opened before the firmament, and all will see together. The children a year old will speak with their voices. The women with child will deliver premature children at three or four months, and they will live and dance. Suddenly the sown places will appear unsown. The full storehouses will suddenly be found empty. The trumpet will give a sound which when every man hears, they will suddenly be afraid. At that time friends will make war against one another like enemies. The earth will stand in fear with those who dwell in it. The springs of the fountains will stand still, so that for three hours they won’t flow.

“It will be that whoever remains after all these things that I have told you of, he will be saved and will see my salvation, and the end of my world. They will see the men who have been taken up, who have not tasted death from their birth. The heart of the inhabitants will be changed and turned into a different spirit. For evil will be blotted out and deceit will be quenched. Faith will flourish. Corruption will be overcome, and the truth, which has been so long without fruit, will be declared.”

When he talked with me, behold, little by little, the place I stood on rocked back and forth. He said to me, “I came to show you these things tonight. If therefore you will pray yet again, and fast seven more days, I will again tell you greater things than these. For your voice has surely been heard before the Most High. For the Mighty has seen your righteousness. He has also seen your purity, which you have maintained ever since your youth. Therefore he has sent me to show you all these things, and to say to you, ‘Believe, and don’t be afraid! Don’t be hasty to think vain things about the former times, that you may not hasten in the latter times.’”

It came to pass after this, that I wept again, and fasted seven days in like manner, that I might fulfill the three weeks which he told me. On the eighth night, my heart was troubled within me again, and I began to speak in the presence of the Most High. For my spirit was greatly aroused, and my soul was in distress. I said, “O Lord, truly you spoke at the beginning of the creation, on the first day, and said this: ‘Let heaven and earth be made,’ and your word perfected the work. Then the spirit was hovering, and darkness and silence were on every side. The sound of man’s voice was not yet there. Then you commanded a ray of light to be brought out of your treasuries, that your works might then appear.

“On the second day, again you made the spirit of the firmament and commanded it to divide and to separate the waters, that the one part might go up, and the other remain beneath.

“On the third day, you commanded that the waters should be gathered together in the seventh part of the earth. You dried up six parts and kept them, to the intent that of these some being both planted and tilled might serve before you. For as soon as your word went out, the work was done. Immediately, great and innumerable fruit grew, with many pleasant tastes, and flowers of inimitable color, and fragrances of most exquisite smell. This was done the third day.

“On the fourth day, you commanded that the sun should shine, the moon give its light, and the stars should be in their order; and gave them a command to serve mankind, who was to be made.

“On the fifth day, you said to the seventh part, where the water was gathered together, that it should produce living creatures, fowls and fishes; and so it came to pass that the mute and lifeless water produced living things as it was told, that the nations might therefore praise your wondrous works.

“Then you preserved two living creatures. The one you called Behemoth, and the other you called Leviathan. You separated the one from the other; for the seventh part, namely, where the water was gathered together, might not hold them both. To Behemoth, you gave one part, which was dried up on the third day, that he should dwell in it, in which are a thousand hills; but to Leviathan you gave the seventh part, namely, the watery part. You have kept them to be devoured by whom you wish, when you wish.

“But on the sixth day, you commanded the earth to produce before you cattle, animals, and creeping things. Over these, you ordained Adam as ruler over all the works that you have made. Of him came all of us, the people whom you have chosen.

“All this have I spoken before you, O Lord, because you have said that for our sakes you made this world. As for the other nations, which also come from Adam, you have said that they are nothing, and are like spittle. You have likened the abundance of them to a drop that falls from a bucket. Now, O Lord, behold these nations, which are reputed as nothing, being rulers over us and devouring us. But we your people, whom you have called your firstborn, your only children, and your fervent lover, are given into their hands. Now if the world is made for our sakes, why don’t we possess our world for an inheritance? How long will this endure?”

### Chapter 7

When I had finished speaking these words, the angel which had been sent to me the nights before was sent to me. He said to me, “Rise, Esdras, and hear the words that I have come to tell you.”

I said, “Speak on, my Lord.”

Then he said to me, “There is a sea set in a wide place, that it might be broad and vast, but its entrance is set in a narrow place so as to be like a river. Whoever desires to go into the sea to look at it, or to rule it, if he didn’t go through the narrow entrance, how could he come into the broad part? Another thing also: There is a city built and set in a plain country, and full of all good things, but its entrance is narrow, and is set in a dangerous place to fall, having fire on the right hand, and deep water on the left. There is one only path between them both, even between the fire and the water, so that only one person can go there at once. If this city is now given to a man for an inheritance, if the heir doesn’t pass the danger before him, how will he receive his inheritance?”

I said, “That is so, Lord.”

Then said he to me, “Even so also is Israel’s portion. I made the world for their sakes. What is now done was decreed when Adam transgressed my statutes. Then the entrances of this world were made narrow, sorrowful, and toilsome. They are but few and evil, full of perils, and involved in great toils. For the entrances of the greater world are wide and safe, and produce fruit of immortality. So if those who live don’t enter these difficult and vain things, they can never receive those that are reserved for them. Now therefore why are you disturbed, seeing you are but a corruptible man? Why are you moved, since you are mortal? Why haven’t you considered in your mind that which is to come, rather than that which is present?”

Then I answered and said, “O sovereign Lord, behold, you have ordained in your law that the righteous will inherit these things, but that the ungodly will perish. The righteous therefore will suffer difficult things, and hope for easier things, but those who have done wickedly have suffered the difficult things, and yet will not see the easier things.”

He said to me, “You are not a judge above God, neither do you have more understanding than the Most High. Yes, let many perish who now live, rather than that the law of God which is set before them be despised. For God strictly commanded those who came, even as they came, what they should do to live, and what they should observe to avoid punishment. Nevertheless, they weren’t obedient to him, but spoke against him and imagined for themselves vain things. They made cunning plans of wickedness, and said moreover of the Most High that he doesn’t exist, and they didn’t know his ways. They despised his law and denied his covenants. They haven’t been faithful to his statutes, and haven’t performed his works. Therefore, Esdras, for the empty are empty things, and for the full are the full things. For behold, the time will come, and it will be, when these signs of which I told you before will come to pass, that the bride will appear, even the city coming forth, and she will be seen who now is withdrawn from the earth. Whoever is delivered from the foretold evils will see my wonders. For my son Jesus will be revealed with those who are with him, and those who remain will rejoice four hundred years. After these years my son Christ will die, along with all of those who have the breath of life. Then the world will be turned into the old silence seven days, like as in the first beginning, so that no human will remain. After seven days the world that is not yet awake will be raised up, and what is corruptible will die. The earth will restore those who are asleep in it, and the dust those who dwell in it in silence, and the secret places will deliver those souls that were committed to them. The Most High will be revealed on the judgment seat, and compassion will pass away, and patience will be withdrawn. Only judgment will remain. Truth will stand. Faith will grow strong. Recompense will follow. The reward will be shown. Good deeds will awake, and wicked deeds won’t sleep. The pit of torment will appear, and near it will be the place of rest. The furnace of hell will be shown, and near it the paradise of delight. Then the Most High will say to the nations that are raised from the dead, ‘Look and understand whom you have denied, whom you haven’t served, whose commandments you have despised. Look on this side and on that. Here is delight and rest, and there fire and torments.’ Thus he will speak to them in the day of judgment. This is a day that has neither sun, nor moon, nor stars, neither cloud, nor thunder, nor lightning, neither wind, nor water, nor air, neither darkness, nor evening, nor morning, neither summer, nor spring, nor heat, nor winter, neither frost, nor cold, nor hail, nor rain, nor dew, neither noon, nor night, nor dawn, neither shining, nor brightness, nor light, except only the splendor of the glory of the Most High, by which all will see the things that are set before them. It will endure as though it were a week of years. This is my judgment and its prescribed order; but I have only shown these things to you.”

I answered, “I said then, O Lord, and I say now: Blessed are those who are now alive and keep your commandments! But what about those for whom I prayed? For who is there of those who are alive who has not sinned, and who of the children of men hasn’t transgressed your covenant? Now I see that the world to come will bring delight to few, but torments to many. For an evil heart has grown up in us, which has led us astray from these commandments and has brought us into corruption and into the ways of death. It has shown us the paths of perdition and removed us far from life—and that, not a few only, but nearly all who have been created.”

He answered me, “Listen to me, and I will instruct you. I will admonish you yet again. For this reason, the Most High has not made one world, but two. For because you have said that the just are not many, but few, and the ungodly abound, hear the explanation. If you have just a few precious stones, will you add them to lead and clay?”

I said, “Lord, how could that be?”

He said to me, “Not only that, but ask the earth, and she will tell you. Defer to her, and she will declare it to you. Say to her, ‘You produce gold, silver, and brass, and also iron, lead, and clay; but silver is more abundant than gold, and brass than silver, and iron than brass, and lead than iron, and clay than lead.’ Judge therefore which things are precious and to be desired, what is abundant or what is rare?”

I said, “O sovereign Lord, that which is plentiful is of less worth, for that which is more rare is more precious.”

He answered me, “Weigh within yourself the things that you have thought, for he who has what is hard to get rejoices over him who has what is plentiful. So also is the judgment which I have promised; for I will rejoice over the few that will be saved, because these are those who have made my glory to prevail now, and through them, my name is now honored. I won’t grieve over the multitude of those who perish; for these are those who are now like mist, and have become like flame and smoke; they are set on fire and burn hotly, and are extinguished.”

I answered, “O earth, why have you produced, if the mind is made out of dust, like all other created things? For it would have been better that the dust itself had been unborn, so that the mind might not have been made from it. But now the mind grows with us, and because of this we are tormented, because we perish and we know it. Let the race of men lament and the animals of the field be glad. Let all who are born lament, but let the four-footed animals and the livestock rejoice. For it is far better with them than with us; for they don’t look forward to judgment, neither do they know of torments or of salvation promised to them after death. For what does it profit us, that we will be preserved alive, but yet be afflicted with torment? For all who are born are defiled with iniquities, and are full of sins and laden with transgressions. If after death we were not to come into judgment, perhaps it would have been better for us.”

He answered me, “When the Most High made the world and Adam and all those who came from him, he first prepared the judgment and the things that pertain to the judgment. Now understand from your own words, for you have said that the mind grows with us. They therefore who dwell on the earth will be tormented for this reason, that having understanding they have committed iniquity, and receiving commandments have not kept them, and having obtained a law they dealt unfaithfully with that which they received. What then will they have to say in the judgment, or how will they answer in the last times? For how long a time has the Most High been patient with those who inhabit the world, and not for their sakes, but because of the times which he has foreordained!”

I answered, “If I have found grace in your sight, O Lord, show this also to your servant, whether after death, even now when every one of us gives up his soul, we will be kept in rest until those times come, in which you renew the creation, or whether we will be tormented immediately.”

He answered me, “I will show you this also; but don’t join yourself with those who are scorners, nor count yourself with those who are tormented. For you have a treasure of works laid up with the Most High, but it won’t be shown you until the last times. For concerning death the teaching is: When the decisive sentence has gone out from the Most High that a man shall die, as the spirit leaves the body to return again to him who gave it, it adores the glory of the Most High first of all. And if it is one of those who have been scorners and have not kept the way of the Most High, and that have despised his law, and who hate those who fear God, these spirits won’t enter into habitations, but will wander and be in torments immediately, ever grieving and sad, in seven ways. The first way, because they have despised the law of the Most High. The second way, because they can’t now make a good repentance that they may live. The third way, they will see the reward laid up for those who have believed the covenants of the Most High. The fourth way, they will consider the torment laid up for themselves in the last days. The fifth way, they will see the dwelling places of the others guarded by angels, with great quietness. The sixth way, they will see how immediately some of them will pass into torment. The seventh way, which is more grievous than all the aforesaid ways, because they will pine away in confusion and be consumed with shame, and will be withered up by fears, seeing the glory of the Most High before whom they have sinned while living, and before whom they will be judged in the last times.

“Now this is the order of those who have kept the ways of the Most High, when they will be separated from their mortal body. In the time that they lived in it, they painfully served the Most High, and were in jeopardy every hour, that they might keep the law of the lawgiver perfectly. Therefore this is the teaching concerning them: First of all they will see with great joy the glory of him who takes them up, for they will have rest in seven orders. The first order, because they have labored with great effort to overcome the evil thought which was fashioned together with them, that it might not lead them astray from life into death. The second order, because they see the perplexity in which the souls of the ungodly wander, and the punishment that awaits them. The third order, they see the testimony which he who fashioned them gives concerning them, that while they lived they kept the law which was given them in trust. The fourth order, they understand the rest which, being gathered in their chambers, they now enjoy with great quietness, guarded by angels, and the glory that awaits them in the last days. The fifth order, they rejoice that they have now escaped from that which is corruptible, and that they will inherit that which is to come, while they see in addition the difficulty and the pain from which they have been delivered, and the spacious liberty which they will receive with joy and immortality. The sixth order, when it is shown to them how their face will shine like the sun, and how they will be made like the light of the stars, being incorruptible from then on. The seventh order, which is greater than all the previously mentioned orders, because they will rejoice with confidence, and because they will be bold without confusion, and will be glad without fear, for they hurry to see the face of him whom in their lifetime they served, and from whom they will receive their reward in glory. This is the order of the souls of the just, as from henceforth is announced to them. Previously mentioned are the ways of torture which those who would not give heed will suffer from after this.”

I answered, “Will time therefore be given to the souls after they are separated from the bodies, that they may see what you have described to me?”

He said, “Their freedom will be for seven days, that for seven days they may see the things you have been told, and afterwards they will be gathered together in their habitations.”

I answered, “If I have found favor in your sight, show further to me your servant whether in the day of judgment the just will be able to intercede for the ungodly or to entreat the Most High for them, whether fathers for children, or children for parents, or kindred for kindred, or kinsfolk for their next of kin, or friends for those who are most dear.”

He answered me, “Since you have found favor in my sight, I will show you this also. The day of judgment is a day of decision, and displays to all the seal of truth. Even as now a father doesn’t send his son, or a son his father, or a master his slave, or a friend him that is most dear, that in his place he may understand, or sleep, or eat, or be healed, so no one will ever pray for another in that day, neither will one lay a burden on another, for then everyone will each bear his own righteousness or unrighteousness.”

I answered, “How do we now find that first Abraham prayed for the people of Sodom, and Moses for the ancestors who sinned in the wilderness, and Joshua after him for Israel in the days of Achan, and Samuel in the days of Saul, and David for the plague, and Solomon for those who would worship in the sanctuary, and Elijah for those that received rain, and for the dead, that he might live, and Hezekiah for the people in the days of Sennacherib, and many others prayed for many? If therefore now, when corruption has grown and unrighteousness increased, the righteous have prayed for the ungodly, why will it not be so then also?”

He answered me, “This present world is not the end. The full glory doesn’t remain in it. Therefore those who were able prayed for the weak. But the day of judgment will be the end of this age, and the beginning of the immortality to come, in which corruption has passed away, intemperance is at an end, infidelity is cut off, but righteousness has grown, and truth has sprung up. Then no one will be able to have mercy on him who is condemned in judgment, nor to harm someone who is victorious.”

I answered then, “This is my first and last saying, that it would have been better if the earth had not produced Adam, or else, when it had produced him, to have restrained him from sinning. For what profit is it for all who are in this present time to live in heaviness, and after death to look for punishment? O Adam, what have you done? For though it was you who sinned, the evil hasn’t fallen on you alone, but on all of us who come from you. For what profit is it to us, if an immortal time is promised to us, but we have done deeds that bring death? And that there is promised us an everlasting hope, but we have most miserably failed? And that there are reserved habitations of health and safety, but we have lived wickedly? And that the glory of the Most High will defend those who have led a pure life, but we have walked in the most wicked ways of all? And that a paradise will be revealed, whose fruit endures without decay, in which is abundance and healing, but we won’t enter into it, for we have lived in perverse ways? And that the faces of those who have practiced self-control will shine more than the stars, but our faces will be blacker than darkness? For while we lived and committed iniquity, we didn’t consider what we would have to suffer after death.”

Then he answered, “This is the significance of the battle which humans born on the earth will fight: if they are overcome, they will suffer as you have said, but if they get the victory, they will receive the thing that I say. For this is the way that Moses spoke to the people while he lived, saying, ‘Choose life, that you may live!’ Nevertheless they didn’t believe him or the prophets after him, not even me, who have spoken to them. Therefore there won’t be such heaviness in their destruction, as there will be joy over those who are assured of salvation.”

Then I answered, “I know, Lord, that the Most High is now called merciful, in that he has mercy upon those who have not yet come into the world; and compassionate, in that he has compassion upon those who turn to his law; and patient, in that he is patient with those who have sinned, since they are his creatures; and bountiful, in that he is ready to give rather than to take away; and very merciful, in that he multiplies more and more mercies to those who are present, and who are past, and also to those who are to come— for if he wasn’t merciful, the world wouldn’t continue with those who dwell in it— and one who forgives, for if he didn’t forgive out of his goodness, that those who have committed iniquities might be relieved of them, not even one ten thousandth part of mankind would remain living; and a judge, for if he didn’t pardon those who were created by his word, and blot out the multitude of sins, there would perhaps be very few left of an innumerable multitude.”

### Chapter 8

He answered me, “The Most High has made this world for many, but the world to come for few. Now I will tell you a parable, Esdras. Just as when you ask the earth, it will say to you that it gives very much clay from which earthen vessels are made, but little dust that gold comes from. Even so is the course of the present world. Many have been created, but few will be saved.”

I answered, “Drink your fill of understanding then, O my soul, and let my heart devour wisdom. For you have come here apart from your will, and depart against your will, for you have only been given a short time to live. O Lord over us, grant to your servant that we may pray before you, and give us seed for our heart and cultivation for our understanding, that fruit may grow from it, by which everyone who is corrupt, who bears the likeness of a man, may live. For you alone exist, and we all one workmanship of your hands, just as you have said. Because you give life to the body that is now fashioned in the womb, and give it members, your creature is preserved in fire and water, and your workmanship endures nine months as your creation which is created in it. But that which keeps and that which is kept will both be kept by your keeping. When the womb gives up again what has grown in it, you have commanded that out of the parts of the body, that is to say, out of the breasts, be given milk, which is the fruit of the breasts, that the body that is fashioned may be nourished for a time, and afterwards you guide it in your mercy. Yes, you have brought it up in your righteousness, nurtured it in your law, and corrected it with your judgment. You put it to death as your creation, and make it live as your work. If therefore you lightly and suddenly destroy him which with so great labor was fashioned by your commandment, to what purpose was he made? Now therefore I will speak. About man in general, you know best, but about your people for whose sake I am sorry, and for your inheritance, for whose cause I mourn, for Israel, for whom I am heavy, and for the seed of Jacob, for whose sake I am troubled, therefore I will begin to pray before you for myself and for them; for I see the failings of us who dwell in the land; but I have heard the swiftness of the judgment which is to come. Therefore hear my voice, and understand my saying, and I will speak before you.”

The beginning of the words of Esdras, before he was taken up. He said, “O Lord, you who remain forever, whose eyes are exalted, and whose chambers are in the air, whose throne is beyond measure, whose glory is beyond comprehension, before whom the army of angels stand with trembling, at whose bidding they are changed to wind and fire, whose word is sure, and sayings constant, whose ordinance is strong, and commandment fearful, whose look dries up the depths, and whose indignation makes the mountains to melt away, and whose truth bears witness— hear, O Lord, the prayer of your servant, and give ear to the petition of your handiwork. Attend to my words, for as long as I live, I will speak, and as long as I have understanding, I will answer. Don’t look at the sins of your people, but on those who have served you in truth. Don’t regard the doings of those who act wickedly, but of those who have kept your covenants in affliction. Don’t think about those who have lived wickedly before you, but remember those who have willingly known your fear. Let it not be your will to destroy those who have lived like cattle, but look at those who have clearly taught your law. Don’t be indignant at those who are deemed worse than animals, but love those who have always put their trust in your glory. For we and our fathers have passed our lives in ways that bring death, but you are called merciful because of us sinners. For if you have a desire to have mercy upon us who have no works of righteousness, then you will be called merciful. For the just, which have many good works laid up with you, will be rewarded for their own deeds. For what is man, that you should take displeasure at him? Or what is a corruptible race, that you should be so bitter toward it? For in truth, there is no man among those who are born who has not done wickedly, and among those who have lived, there is none which have not done wrong. For in this, O Lord, your righteousness and your goodness will be declared, if you are merciful to those who have no store of good works.”

Then he answered me, “Some things you have spoken rightly, and it will happen according to your words. For indeed I will not think about the fashioning of those who have sinned, or about their death, their judgment, or their destruction; but I will rejoice over the creation of the righteous and their pilgrimage, their salvation, and the reward that they will have. Therefore as I have spoken, so it will be. For as the farmer sows many seeds in the ground, and plants many trees, and yet not all that is sown will come up in due season, neither will all that is planted take root, even so those who are sown in the world will not all be saved.”

Then I answered, “If I have found favor, let me speak before you. If the farmer’s seed doesn’t come up because it hasn’t received your rain in due season, or if it is ruined by too much rain and perishes, likewise man, who is formed with your hands and is called your own image, because he is made like you, for whose sake you have formed all things, even him have you made like the farmer’s seed. Don’t be angry with us, but spare your people and have mercy upon your inheritance, for you have mercy upon your own creation.”

Then he answered me, “Things present are for those who live now, and things to come for those who will live hereafter. For you come far short of being able to love my creature more than I. But you have compared yourself to the unrighteous. Don’t do that! Yet in this will you be admirable to the Most High, in that you have humbled yourself, as it becomes you, and have not judged yourself among the righteous, so as to be much glorified. For many grievous miseries will fall on those who dwell in the world in the last times, because they have walked in great pride. But understand for yourself, and for those who inquire concerning the glory of those like you, because paradise is opened to you. The tree of life is planted. The time to come is prepared. Plenteousness is made ready. A city is built. Rest is allowed. Goodness is perfected, and wisdom is perfected beforehand. The root of evil is sealed up from you. Weakness is done away from you, and death is hidden. Hell and corruption have fled into forgetfulness. Sorrows have passed away, and in the end, the treasure of immortality is shown. Therefore ask no more questions concerning the multitude of those who perish. For when they had received liberty, they despised the Most High, scorned his law, and forsook his ways. Moreover they have trodden down his righteous, and said in their heart that there is no God—even knowing that they must die. For as the things I have said will welcome you, so thirst and pain which are prepared for them. For the Most High didn’t intend that men should be destroyed, but those who are created have themselves defiled the name of him who made them, and were unthankful to him who prepared life for them. Therefore my judgment is now at hand, which I have not shown to all men, but to you, and a few like you.”

Then I answered, “Behold, O Lord, now you have shown me the multitude of the wonders which you will do in the last times, but you haven’t shown me when.”

### Chapter 9

He answered me, “Measure diligently within yourself. When you see that a certain part of the signs are past, which have been told you beforehand, then will you understand that it is the very time in which the Most High will visit the world which was made by him. When earthquakes, tumult of peoples, plans of nations, wavering of leaders, and confusion of princes are seen in the world, then will you understand that the Most High spoke of these things from the days that were of old, from the beginning. For just as with everything that is made in the world, the beginning is evident and the end manifest, so also are the times of the Most High: the beginnings are manifest in wonders and mighty works, and the end in effects and signs. Everyone who will be saved, and will be able to escape by his works, or by faith by which they have believed, will be preserved from the said perils, and will see my salvation in my land and within my borders, which I have sanctified for myself from the beginning. Then those who now have abused my ways will be amazed. Those who have cast them away despitefully will live in torments. For as many as in their life have received benefits, and yet have not known me, and as many as have scorned my law, while they still had liberty and when an opportunity to repent was open to them, didn’t understand, but despised it, must know it in torment after death. Therefore don’t be curious any longer how the ungodly will be punished, but inquire how the righteous will be saved, those who the world belongs to, and for whom the world was created.”

I answered, “I have said before, and now speak, and will say it again hereafter, that there are more of those who perish than of those who will be saved, like a wave is greater than a drop.”

He answered me, “Just as the field is, so also the seed. As the flowers are, so are the colors. As the work is, so also is the judgment on it. As is the farmer, so also is his threshing floor. For there was a time in the world when I was preparing for those who now live, before the world was made for them to dwell in. Then no one spoke against me, for no one existed. But now those who are created in this world that is prepared, both with a table that doesn’t fail and a law which is unsearchable, are corrupted in their ways. So I considered my world, and behold, it was destroyed, and my earth, and behold, it was in peril, because of the plans that had come into it. I saw and spared them, but not greatly, and saved myself a grape out of a cluster, and a plant out of a great forest. Let the multitude perish then, which were born in vain. Let my grape be saved, and my plant, for I have made them perfect with great labor. Nevertheless, if you will wait seven more days—however don’t fast in them, but go into a field of flowers, where no house is built, and eat only of the flowers of the field, and you shall taste no flesh, and shall drink no wine, but shall eat flowers only— and pray to the Most High continually, then I will come and talk with you.”

So I went my way, just as he commanded me, into the field which is called Ardat. There I sat among the flowers, and ate of the herbs of the field, and this food satisfied me. It came to pass after seven days that I lay on the grass, and my heart was troubled again, like before. My mouth was opened, and I began to speak before the Lord Most High, and said, “O Lord, you showed yourself among us, to our fathers in the wilderness, when they went out of Egypt, and when they came into the wilderness, where no man treads and that bears no fruit. You said, ‘Hear me, O Israel. Heed my words, O seed of Jacob. For behold, I sow my law in you, and it will bring forth fruit in you, and you will be glorified in it forever.’ But our fathers, who received the law, didn’t keep it, and didn’t observe the statutes. The fruit of the law didn’t perish, for it couldn’t, because it was yours. Yet those who received it perished, because they didn’t keep the thing that was sown in them. Behold, it is a custom that when the ground has received seed, or the sea a ship, or any vessel food or drink, and when it comes to pass that that which is sown, or that which is launched, or the things which have been received, should come to an end, these come to an end, but the receptacles remain. Yet with us, it doesn’t happen that way. For we who have received the law will perish by sin, along with our heart which received it. Notwithstanding the law doesn’t perish, but remains in its honor.”

When I spoke these things in my heart, I looked around me with my eyes, and on my right side I saw a woman, and behold, she mourned and wept with a loud voice, and was much grieved in mind. Her clothes were torn, and she had ashes on her head. Then let I my thoughts go in which I was occupied, and turned myself to her, and said to her, “Why are you weeping? Why are you grieved in your mind?”

She said to me, “Leave me alone, my Lord, that I may weep for myself and add to my sorrow, for I am very troubled in my mind, and brought very low.”

I said to her, “What ails you? Tell me.”

She said to me, “I, your servant, was barren and had no child, though I had a husband thirty years. Every hour and every day these thirty years I made my prayer to the Most High day and night. It came to pass after thirty years that God heard me, your handmaid, and saw my low estate, and considered my trouble, and gave me a son. I rejoiced in him greatly, I and my husband, and all my neighbors. We gave great honor to the Mighty One. I nourished him with great care. So when he grew up, and I came to take him a wife, I made him a feast day.

### Chapter 10

“So it came to pass that when my son was entered into his wedding chamber, he fell down and died. Then we all put out the lamps, and all my neighbors rose up to comfort me. I remained quiet until the second day at night. It came to pass, when they had all stopped consoling me, encouraging me to be quiet, then rose I up by night, and fled, and came here into this field, as you see. Now I don’t intend to return into the city, but to stay here, and not eat or drink, but to continually mourn and fast until I die.”

Then I left the reflections I was engaged in, and answered her in anger, “You most foolish woman, don’t you see our mourning, and what has happened to us? For Zion the mother of us all is full of sorrow, and much humbled. It is right now to mourn deeply, since we all mourn, and to be sorrowful, since we are all in sorrow, but you are mourning for one son. Ask the earth, and she will tell you that it is she which ought to mourn for so many that grow upon her. For out of her, all had their beginnings, and others will come; and, behold, almost all of them walk into destruction, and the multitude of them is utterly doomed. Who then should mourn more, she who has lost so great a multitude, or you, who are grieved but for one? But if you say to me, ‘My lamentation is not like the earth’s, for I have lost the fruit of my womb, which I brought forth with pains, and bare with sorrows;’ but it is with the earth after the manner of the earth. The multitude present in it has gone as it came. Then say I to you, ‘Just as you have brought forth with sorrow, even so the earth also has given her fruit, namely, people, ever since the beginning to him who made her.’ Now therefore keep your sorrow to yourself, and bear with a good courage the adversities which have happened to you. For if you will acknowledge the decree of God to be just, you will both receive your son in time, and will be praised among women. Go your way then into the city to your husband.”

She said to me, “I won’t do that. I will not go into the city, but I will die here.”

So I proceeded to speak further to her, and said, “Don’t do so, but allow yourself to be persuaded by reason of the adversities of Zion; and be comforted by reason of the sorrow of Jerusalem. For you see that our sanctuary has been laid waste, our altar broken down, our temple destroyed, our lute has been brought low, our song is put to silence, our rejoicing is at an end, the light of our candlestick is put out, the ark of our covenant is plundered, our holy things are defiled, and the name that we are called is profaned. Our free men are despitefully treated, our priests are burned, our Levites have gone into captivity, our virgins are defiled and our wives ravished, our righteous men carried away, our little ones betrayed, our young men are brought into bondage, and our strong men have become weak. What is more than all, the seal of Zion has now lost the seal of her honor, and is delivered into the hands of those who hate us. Therefore shake off your great heaviness, and put away from yourself the multitude of sorrows, that the Mighty One may be merciful to you again, and the Most High may give you rest, even ease from your troubles.”

It came to pass while I was talking with her, behold, her face suddenly began to shine exceedingly, and her countenance glistered like lightning, so that I was very afraid of her, and wondered what this meant. Behold, suddenly she made a great and very fearful cry, so that the earth shook at the noise. I looked, and behold, the woman appeared to me no more, but there was a city built, and a place shown itself from large foundations. Then I was afraid, and cried with a loud voice, “Where is Uriel the angel, who came to me at the first? For he has caused me to fall into this great trance, and my end has turned into corruption, and my prayer a reproach!”

As I was speaking these words, behold, the angel who had come to me at first came to me, and he looked at me. Behold, I lay as one who had been dead, and my understanding was taken from me. He took me by the right hand, and comforted me, and set me on my feet, and said to me, “What ails you? Why are you so troubled? Why is your understanding and the thoughts of your heart troubled?”

I said, “Because you have forsaken me; yet I did according to your words, and went into the field, and, behold, I have seen, and still see, that which I am not able to explain.”

He said to me, “Stand up like a man, and I will instruct you.”

Then I said, “Speak on, my Lord; only don’t forsake me, lest I die before my time. For I have seen what I didn’t know, and hear what I don’t know. Or is my sense deceived, or my soul in a dream? Now therefore I beg you to explain to your servant what this vision means.”

He answered me, “Listen to me, and I will inform you, and tell you about the things you are afraid of, for the Most High has revealed many secret things to you. He has seen that your way is righteous, because you are continually sorry for your people, and make great lamentation for Zion. This therefore is the meaning of the vision. The woman who appeared to you a little while ago, whom you saw mourning, and began to comfort her, but now you no longer see the likeness of the woman, but a city under construction appeared to you, and she told you of the death of her son, this is the interpretation: This woman, whom you saw, is Zion, whom you now see as a city being built. She told you that she had been barren for thirty years because there were three thousand years in the world in which there was no offering as yet offered in her. And it came to pass after three thousand years that Solomon built the city and offered offerings. It was then that the barren bore a son. She told you that she nourished him with great care. That was the dwelling in Jerusalem. When she said to you, ‘My son died when he entered into his marriage chamber, and that misfortune befell her,’ this was the destruction that came to Jerusalem. Behold, you saw her likeness, how she mourned for her son, and you began to comfort her for what has happened to her. These were the things to be opened to you. For now the Most High, seeing that you are sincerely grieved and suffer from your whole heart for her, has shown you the brightness of her glory and the attractiveness of her beauty. Therefore I asked you to remain in the field where no house was built, for I knew that the Most High would show this to you. Therefore I commanded you to come into the field, where no foundation of any building was. For no human construction could stand in the place in which the city of the Most High was to be shown. Therefore don’t be afraid nor let your heart be terrified, but go your way in and see the beauty and greatness of the building, as much as your eyes are able to see. Then will you hear as much as your ears may comprehend. For you are more blessed than many, and are called by name to be with the Most High, like only a few. But tomorrow at night you shall remain here, and so the Most High will show you those visions in dreams of what the Most High will do to those who live on the earth in the last days.”

So I slept that night and another, as he commanded me.

### Chapter 11

It came to pass the second night that I saw a dream, and behold, an eagle which had twelve feathered wings and three heads came up from the sea. I saw, and behold, she spread her wings over all the earth, and all the winds of heaven blew on her, and the clouds were gathered together against her. I saw, and out of her wings there grew other wings near them; and they became little, tiny wings. But her heads were at rest. The head in the middle was larger than the other heads, yet rested it with them. Moreover I saw, and behold, the eagle flew with her wings to reign over the earth and over those who dwell therein. I saw how all things under heaven were subject to her, and no one spoke against her—no, not one creature on earth. I saw, and behold, the eagle rose on her talons, and uttered her voice to her wings, saying, “Don’t all watch at the same time. Let each one sleep in his own place and watch in turn; but let the heads be preserved for the last.”

I saw, and behold, the voice didn’t come out of her heads, but from the midst of her body. I counted her wings that were near the others, and behold, there were eight of them. I saw, and behold, on the right side one wing arose and reigned over all the earth. When it reigned, the end of it came, and it disappeared, so that its place appeared no more. The next wing rose up and reigned, and it ruled a long time. It happened that when it reigned, its end came also, so that it disappeared, like the first. Behold, a voice came to it, and said, “Listen, you who have ruled over the earth all this time! I proclaim this to you, before you disappear, none after you will rule as long as you, not even half as long.”

Then the third arose, and ruled as the others before, and it also disappeared. So it went with all the wings one after another, as every one ruled, and then disappeared. I saw, and behold, in process of time the wings that followed were set up on the right side, that they might rule also. Some of them ruled, but in a while they disappeared. Some of them also were set up, but didn’t rule.

After this I saw, and behold, the twelve wings disappeared, along with two of the little wings. There was no more left on the eagle’s body, except the three heads that rested, and six little wings. I saw, and behold, two little wings divided themselves from the six and remained under the head that was on the right side; but four remained in their place. I saw, and behold, these under wings planned to set themselves up and to rule. I saw, and behold, there was one set up, but in a while it disappeared. A second also did so, and it disappeared faster than the first. I saw, and behold, the two that remained also planned between themselves to reign. While they thought about it, behold, one of the heads that were at rest awakened, the one that was in the middle, for that was greater than the two other heads. I saw how it joined the two other heads with it. Behold, the head turned with those who were with it, and ate the two under wings that planned to reign. But this head held the whole earth in possession, and ruled over those who dwell in it with much oppression. It had stronger governance over the world than all the wings that had gone before.

After this I saw, and behold, the head also that was in the middle suddenly disappeared, like the wings. But the two heads remained, which also reigned the same way over the earth and over those who dwell in it. I saw, and behold, the head on the right side devoured the one that was on the left side.

Then I heard a voice, which said to me, “Look in front of you, and consider the thing that you see.”

I saw, and behold, something like a lion roused out of the woods roaring. I heard how he sent out a man’s voice to the eagle, and spoke, saying, “Listen and I will talk with you. The Most High will say to you, ‘Aren’t you the one that remains of the four animals whom I made to reign in my world, that the end of my times might come through them? The fourth came and overcame all the animals that were past, and ruled the world with great trembling, and the whole extent of the earth with grievous oppression. He lived on the earth such a long time with deceit. You have judged the earth, but not with truth. For you have afflicted the meek, you have hurt the peaceful, you have hated those who speak truth, you have loved liars, destroyed the dwellings of those who produced fruit, and threw down the walls of those who did you no harm. Your insolence has come up to the Most High, and your pride to the Mighty. The Most High also has looked at his times, and behold, they are ended, and his ages are fulfilled. Therefore appear no more, you eagle, nor your horrible wings, nor your evil little wings, nor your cruel heads, nor your hurtful talons, nor all your worthless body, that all the earth may be refreshed and relieved, being delivered from your violence, and that she may hope for the judgment and mercy of him who made her.’”

### Chapter 12

It came to pass, while the lion spoke these words to the eagle, I saw, and behold, the head that remained disappeared, and the two wings which went over to it arose and set themselves up to reign; and their kingdom was brief and full of uproar. I saw, and behold, they disappeared, and the whole body of the eagle was burned, so that the earth was in great fear.

Then I woke up because of great perplexity of mind and great fear, and said to my spirit, “Behold, you have done this to me, because you search out the ways of the Most High. Behold, I am still weary in my mind, and very weak in my spirit. There isn’t even a little strength in me, because of the great fear with which I was frightened tonight. Therefore I will now ask the Most High that he would strengthen me to the end.”

Then I said, “O sovereign Lord, if I have found favor in your sight, and if I am justified with you more than many others, and if my prayer has indeed come up before your face, strengthen me then, and show me, your servant, the interpretation and plain meaning of this fearful vision, that you may fully comfort my soul. For you have judged me worthy to show me the end of time and the last events of the times.”

He said to me, “This is the interpretation of this vision which you saw: The eagle, whom you saw come up from the sea, is the fourth kingdom which appeared in a vision to your brother Daniel. But it was not explained to him, as I now explain it to you or have explained it. Behold, the days come that a kingdom will rise up on earth, and it will be feared more than all the kingdoms that were before it. Twelve kings will reign in it, one after another. Of those, the second will begin to reign, and will reign a longer time than others of the twelve. This is the interpretation of the twelve wings which you saw. As for when you heard a voice which spoke, not going out from the heads, but from the midst of its body, this is the interpretation: That after the time of that kingdom, there will arise no small contentions, and it will stand in peril of falling. Nevertheless, it won’t fall then, but will be restored again to its former power. You saw the eight under wings sticking to her wings. This is the interpretation: That in it eight kings will arise, whose times will be short and their years swift. Two of them will perish when the middle time approaches. Four will be kept for a while until the time of the ending of it will approach; but two will be kept to the end. You saw three heads resting. This is the interpretation: In its last days, the Most High will raise up three kingdoms and renew many things in them. They will rule over the earth, and over those who dwell in it, with much oppression, more than all those who were before them. Therefore they are called the heads of the eagle. For these are those who will accomplish her wickedness, and who will finish her last actions. You saw that the great head disappeared. It signifies that one of them will die on his bed, and yet with pain. But for the two that remained, the sword will devour them. For the sword of the one will devour him that was with him, but he will also fall by the sword in the last days. You saw two under wings passing over to the head that is on the right side. This is the interpretation: These are they whom the Most High has kept to his end. This is the brief reign that was full of trouble, as you saw.

“The lion, whom you saw rising up out of the forest, roaring, speaking to the eagle, and rebuking her for her unrighteousness, and all her words which you have heard, this is the anointed one, whom the Most High has kept to the end [of days, who will spring up out of the seed of David, and he will come and speak] to them and reprove them for their wickedness and unrighteousness, and will heap up before them their contemptuous dealings. For at first he will set them alive in his judgment, and when he has reproved them, he will destroy them. For he will deliver the rest of my people with mercy, those who have been preserved throughout my borders, and he will make them joyful until the coming of the end, even the day of judgment, about which I have spoken to you from the beginning. This is the dream that you saw, and this is its interpretation. Only you have been worthy to know the secret of the Most High. Therefore write all these things that you have seen in a book, and put it in a secret place. You shall teach them to the wise of your people, whose hearts you know are able to comprehend and keep these secrets. But wait here yourself seven more days, that you may be shown whatever it pleases the Most High to show you.” Then he departed from me.

It came to pass, when all the people saw that the seven days were past, and I had not come again into the city, they all gathered together, from the least to the greatest, and came to me, and spoke to me, saying, “How have we offended you? What evil have we done against you, that you have utterly forsaken us, and sit in this place? For of all the prophets, only you are left to us, like a cluster of the vintage, and like a lamp in a dark place, and like a harbor for a ship saved from the tempest. Aren’t the evils which have come to us sufficient? If you will forsake us, how much better had it been for us if we also had been consumed in the burning of Zion! For we are not better than those who died there.” Then they wept with a loud voice. I answered them, “Take courage, O Israel! Don’t be sorrowful, you house of Jacob; for the Most High remembers you. The Mighty has not forgotten you forever. As for me, I have not forsaken you. I haven’t departed from you; but I have come into this place to pray for the desolation of Zion, and that I might seek mercy for the humiliation of your sanctuary. Now go your way, every man to his own house, and after these days I will come to you.”

So the people went their way into the city, as I told them to do. But I sat in the field seven days, as the angel commanded me. In those days, I ate only of the flowers of the field, and my food was from plants.

### Chapter 13

It came to pass after seven days, I dreamed a dream by night. Behold, a wind arose from the sea that moved all its waves. I saw, and behold, [this wind caused to come up from the midst of the sea something like the appearance of a man. I saw, and behold,] that man flew with the clouds of heaven. When he turned his face to look, everything that he saw trembled. Whenever the voice went out of his mouth, all who heard his voice melted, like the wax melts when it feels the fire.

After this I saw, and behold, an innumerable multitude of people was gathered together from the four winds of heaven to make war against the man who came out of the sea. I saw, and behold, he carved himself a great mountain, and flew up onto it. I tried to see the region or place from which the mountain was carved, and I couldn’t.

After this I saw, and behold, all those who were gathered together to fight against him were very afraid, and yet they dared to fight. Behold, as he saw the assault of the multitude that came, he didn’t lift up his hand, or hold a spear or any weapon of war; but I saw only how he sent out of his mouth something like a flood of fire, and out of his lips a flaming breath, and out of his tongue he shot out a storm of sparks. These were all mixed together: the flood of fire, the flaming breath, and the great storm, and fell upon the assault of the multitude which was prepared to fight, and burned up every one of them, so that all of a sudden an innumerable multitude was seen to be nothing but dust of ashes and smell of smoke. When I saw this, I was amazed.

Afterward, I saw the same man come down from the mountain, and call to himself another multitude which was peaceful. Many people came to him. Some of them were glad. Some were sorry. Some of them were bound, and some others brought some of those as offerings. Then through great fear I woke up and prayed to the Most High, and said, “You have shown your servant these wonders from the beginning, and have counted me worthy that you should receive my prayer. Now show me also the interpretation of this dream. For as I conceive in my understanding, woe to those who will be left in those days! Much more woe to those who are not left! For those who were not left will be in heaviness, understanding the things that are laid up in the latter days, but not attaining to them. But woe to them also who are left, because they will see great perils and much distress, like these dreams declare. Yet is it better for one to be in peril and to come into these things, than to pass away as a cloud out of the world, and not to see the things that will happen in the last days.”

He answered me, “I will tell you the interpretation of the vision, and I will also open to you the things about which you mentioned. You have spoken of those who are left behind. This is the interpretation: He that will endure the peril in that time will protect those who fall into danger, even those who have works and faith toward the Almighty. Know therefore that those who are left behind are more blessed than those who are dead. These are the interpretations of the vision: Whereas you saw a man coming up from the midst of the sea, this is he whom the Most High has been keeping for many ages, who by his own self will deliver his creation. He will direct those who are left behind. Whereas you saw that out of his mouth came wind, fire, and storm, and whereas he held neither spear, nor any weapon of war, but destroyed the assault of that multitude which came to fight against him, this is the interpretation: Behold, the days come when the Most High will begin to deliver those who are on the earth. Astonishment of mind will come upon those who dwell on the earth. One will plan to make war against another, city against city, place against place, people against people, and kingdom against kingdom. It will be, when these things come to pass, and the signs happen which I showed you before, then my Son will be revealed, whom you saw as a man ascending. It will be, when all the nations hear his voice, every man will leave his own land and the battle they have against one another. An innumerable multitude will be gathered together, as you saw, desiring to come and to fight against him. But he will stand on the top of Mount Zion. Zion will come, and will be shown to all men, being prepared and built, like you saw the mountain carved without hands. My Son will rebuke the nations which have come for their wickedness, with plagues that are like a storm, and will rebuke them to their face with their evil thoughts, and the torments with which they will be tormented, which are like a flame. He will destroy them without labor by the law, which is like fire. Whereas you saw that he gathered to himself another multitude that was peaceful, these are the ten tribes which were led away out of their own land in the time of Osea the king, whom Salmananser the king of the Assyrians led away captive, and he carried them beyond the River, and they were taken into another land. But they made this plan among themselves, that they would leave the multitude of the heathen, and go out into a more distant region, where mankind had never lived, that there they might keep their statutes which they had not kept in their own land. They entered by the narrow passages of the river Euphrates. For the Most High then did signs for them, and stopped the springs of the River until they had passed over. For through that country there was a long way to go, namely, of a year and a half. The same region is called Arzareth. Then they lived there until the latter time. Now when they begin to come again, the Most High stops the springs of the River again, that they may go through. Therefore you saw the multitude gathered together with peace. But those who are left behind of your people are those who are found within my holy border. It will be therefore when he will destroy the multitude of the nations that are gathered together, he will defend the people who remain. Then will he show them very many wonders.”

Then I said, “O sovereign Lord, explain this to me: Why have I seen the man coming up from the midst of the sea?”

He said to me, as no one can explore or know what is in the depths of the sea, even so no man on earth can see my Son, or those who are with him, except in the time of his day. This is the interpretation of the dream which you saw, and for this only you are enlightened about this, for you have forsaken your own ways, and applied your diligence to mine, and have searched out my law. You have ordered your life in wisdom, and have called understanding your mother. Therefore I have shown you this, for there is a reward laid up with the Most High. It will be, after another three days I will speak other things to you, and declare to you mighty and wondrous things.”

Then I went out and passed into the field, giving praise and thanks greatly to the Most High because of his wonders, which he did from time to time, and because he governs the time, and such things as happen in their seasons. So I sat there three days.

### Chapter 14

It came to pass upon the third day, I sat under an oak, and, behold, a voice came out of a bush near me, and said, “Esdras, Esdras!”

I said, “Here I am, Lord,” and I stood up on my feet.

Then he said to me, “I revealed myself in a bush and talked with Moses when my people were in bondage in Egypt. I sent him, and he led my people out of Egypt. I brought him up to Mount Sinai, where I kept him with me for many days. I told him many wondrous things, and showed him the secrets of the times and the end of the seasons. I commanded him, saying, ‘You shall publish these openly, and these you shall hide.’ Now I say to you: Lay up in your heart the signs that I have shown, the dreams that you have seen, and the interpretations which you have heard; for you will be taken away from men, and from now on you will live with my Son and with those who are like you, until the times have ended. For the world has lost its youth, and the times begin to grow old. For the age is divided into twelve parts, and ten parts of it are already gone, even the half of the tenth part. There remain of it two parts after the middle of the tenth part. Now therefore set your house in order, reprove your people, comfort the lowly among them, and instruct those of them who are wise, and now renounce the life that is corruptible, and let go of the mortal thoughts, cast away from you the burdens of man, put off now your weak nature, lay aside the thoughts that are most grievous to you, and hurry to escape from these times. For worse evils than those which you have seen happen will be done after this. For look how much the world will be weaker through age, so much that more evils will increase on those who dwell in it. For the truth will withdraw itself further off, and falsehood will be near. For now the eagle which you saw in vision hurries to come.”

Then I answered and said, “Let me speak in your presence, O Lord. Behold, I will go, as you have commanded me, and reprove the people who now live, but who will warn those who will be born afterward? For the world is set in darkness, and those who dwell in it are without light. For your law has been burned, therefore no one knows the things that are done by you, or the works that will be done. But if I have found favor before you, send the Holy Spirit to me, and I will write all that has been done in the world since the beginning, even the things that were written in your law, that men may be able to find the path, and that those who would live in the latter days may live.”

He answered me and said, “Go your way, gather the people together, and tell them not to seek you for forty days. But prepare for yourself many tablets, and take with you Sarea, Dabria, Selemia, Ethanus, and Asiel, these five, which are ready to write swiftly; and come here, and I will light a lamp of understanding in your heart which will not be put out until the things have ended about which you will write. When you are done, some things you shall publish openly, and some things you shall deliver in secret to the wise. Tomorrow at this hour you will begin to write.”

Then went I out, as he commanded me, and gathered all the people together, and said, “Hear these words, O Israel! Our fathers at the beginning were foreigners in Egypt, and they were delivered from there, and received the law of life, which they didn’t keep, which you also have transgressed after them. Then the land of Zion was given to you for a possession; but you yourselves and your ancestors have done unrighteousness, and have not kept the ways which the Most High commanded you. Because he is a righteous judge, in due time, he took from you what he had given you. Now you are here, and your kindred are among you. Therefore if you will rule over your own understanding and instruct your hearts, you will be kept alive, and after death you will obtain mercy. For after death the judgment will come, when we will live again. Then the names of the righteous will become manifest, and the works of the ungodly will be declared. Let no one therefore come to me now, nor seek me for forty days.”

So I took the five men, as he commanded me, and we went out into the field, and remained there. It came to pass on the next day that, behold, a voice called me, saying, “Esdras, open your mouth, and drink what I give you to drink.”

Then opened I my mouth, and behold, a full cup was handed to me. It was full of something like water, but its color was like fire. I took it, and drank. When I had drunk it, my heart uttered understanding, and wisdom grew in my breast, for my spirit retained its memory. My mouth was opened, and shut no more. The Most High gave understanding to the five men, and they wrote by course the things that were told them, in characters which they didn’t know, and they sat forty days. Now they wrote in the day-time, and at night they ate bread. As for me, I spoke in the day, and by night I didn’t hold my tongue. So in forty days, ninety-four books were written.

It came to pass, when the forty days were fulfilled, that the Most High spoke to me, saying, “The first books that you have written, publish openly, and let the worthy and unworthy read them; but keep the last seventy, that you may deliver them to those who are wise among your people; for in them is the spring of understanding, the fountain of wisdom, and the stream of knowledge.”

I did so.

### Chapter 15

“Behold, speak in the ears of my people the words of prophecy which I will put in your mouth,” says the Lord. “Cause them to be written on paper, for they are faithful and true. Don’t be afraid of their plots against you. Don’t let the unbelief of those who speak against you trouble you. For all the unbelievers will die in their unbelief.

“Behold,” says the Lord, “I bring evils on the whole earth: sword, famine, death, and destruction. For wickedness has prevailed over every land, and their hurtful works have reached their limit. Therefore,” says the Lord, “I will hold my peace no more concerning their wickedness which they profanely commit, neither will I tolerate them in these things, which they wickedly practice. Behold, the innocent and righteous blood cries to me, and the souls of the righteous cry out continually. I will surely avenge them,” says the Lord, “and will receive to me all the innocent blood from among them. Behold, my people is led like a flock to the slaughter. I will not allow them now to dwell in the land of Egypt, but I will bring them out with a mighty hand and with a high arm, and will strike Egypt with plagues, as before, and will destroy all its land.”

Let Egypt and its foundations mourn, for the plague of the chastisement and the punishment that God will bring upon it. Let the farmers that till the ground mourn, for their seeds will fail and their trees will be ruined through the blight and hail, and a terrible tempest. Woe to the world and those who dwell in it! For the sword and their destruction draws near, and nation will rise up against nation to battle with weapons in their hands. For there will be sedition among men, and growing strong against one another. In their might, they won’t respect their king or the chief of their great ones. For a man will desire to go into a city, and will not be able. For because of their pride the cities will be troubled, the houses will be destroyed, and men will be afraid. A man will have no pity on his neighbors, but will assault their houses with the sword and plunder their goods, because of the lack of bread, and for great suffering.

“Behold,” says God, “I call together all the kings of the earth to stir up those who are from the rising of the sun, from the south, from the east, and Libanus, to turn themselves one against another, and repay the things that they have done to them. Just as they do yet this day to my chosen, so I will do also, and repay into their bosom.” The Lord God says: “My right hand won’t spare the sinners, and my sword won’t cease over those who shed innocent blood on the earth. A fire has gone out from his wrath and has consumed the foundations of the earth and the sinners, like burnt straw. Woe to those who sin and don’t keep my commandments!” says the Lord. “I will not spare them. Go your way, you rebellious children! Don’t defile my sanctuary!” For the Lord knows all those who trespass against him, therefore he will deliver them to death and destruction. For now evils have come upon the whole earth, and you will remain in them; for God will not deliver you, because you have sinned against him.

Behold, a horrible sight appearing from the east! The nations of the dragons of Arabia will come out with many chariots. From the day that they set out, their hissing is carried over the earth, so that all those who will hear them may also fear and tremble. Also the Carmonians, raging in wrath, will go out like the wild boars of the forest. They will come with great power and join battle with them, and will devastate a portion of the land of the Assyrians with their teeth. Then the dragons will have the upper hand, remembering their nature. If they will turn themselves, conspiring together in great power to persecute them, then these will be troubled, and keep silence through their power, and will turn and flee. From the land of the Assyrians, an enemy in ambush will attack them and destroy one of them. Upon their army will be fear and trembling, and indecision upon their kings.

Behold, clouds from the east, and from the north to the south! They are very horrible to look at, full of wrath and storm. They will clash against one another. They will pour out a heavy storm on the earth, even their own storm. There will be blood from the sword to the horse’s belly, and to the thigh of man, and to the camel’s hock. There will be fearfulness and great trembling upon earth. They who see that wrath will be afraid, and trembling will seize them. After this, great storms will be stirred up from the south, from the north, and another part from the west. Strong winds will arise from the east, and will shut it up, even the cloud which he raised up in wrath; and the storm that was to cause destruction by the east wind will be violently driven toward the south and west. Great and mighty clouds, full of wrath, will be lifted up with the storm, that they may destroy all the earth and those who dwell in it. They will pour out over every high and lofty one a terrible storm, fire, hail, flying swords, and many waters, that all plains may be full, and all rivers, with the abundance of those waters. They will break down the cities and walls, mountains and hills, trees of the forest, and grass of the meadows, and their grain. They will go on steadily to Babylon and destroy her. They will come to it and surround it. They will pour out the storm and all wrath on her. Then the dust and smoke will go up to the sky, and all those who are around it will mourn for it. Those who remain will serve those who have destroyed it.

You, Asia, who are partaker in the beauty of Babylon, and in the glory of her person— woe to you, you wretch, because you have made yourself like her. You have decked out your daughters for prostitution, that they might please and glory in your lovers, which have always lusted after you! You have followed her who is hateful in all her works and inventions. Therefore God says, “I will send evils on you: widowhood, poverty, famine, sword, and pestilence, to lay waste your houses and bring you to destruction and death. The glory of your power will be dried up like a flower when the heat rises that is sent over you. You will be weakened like a poor woman who is beaten and wounded, so that you won’t be able to receive your mighty ones and your lovers. Would I have dealt with you with such jealousy,” says the Lord, “if you had not always slain my chosen, exalting and clapping of your hands, and saying over their dead, when you were drunk?

“Beautify your face! The reward of a prostitute will be in your bosom, therefore you will be repaid. Just as you will do to my chosen,” says the Lord, “even so God will do to you, and will deliver you to your adversaries. Your children will die of hunger. You will fall by the sword. Your cities will be broken down, and all your people in the field will perish by the sword. Those who are in the mountains will die of hunger, eat their own flesh, and drink their own blood, because of hunger for bread and thirst for water. You, unhappy above all others, will come and will again receive evils. In the passage, they will rush on the hateful city and will destroy some portion of your land, and mar part of your glory, and will return again to Babylon that was destroyed. You will be cast down by them as stubble, and they will be to you as fire. They will devour you, your cities, your land, and your mountains. They will burn all your forests and your fruitful trees with fire. They will carry your children away captive, and will plunder your wealth, and mar the glory of your face.”

### Chapter 16

Woe to you, Babylon, and Asia! Woe to you, Egypt and Syria! Put on sackcloth and garments of goats’ hair, wail for your children and lament; for your destruction is at hand. A sword has been sent upon you, and who is there to turn it back? A fire has been sent upon you, and who is there to quench it? Calamities are sent upon you, and who is there to drive them away? Can one drive away a hungry lion in the forest? Can one quench a fire in stubble, once it has begun to burn? Can one turn back an arrow that is shot by a strong archer? The Lord God sends the calamities, and who will drive them away? A fire will go out from his wrath, and who may quench it? He will flash lightning, and who will not fear? He will thunder, and who wouldn’t tremble? The Lord will threaten, and who will not be utterly broken in pieces at his presence? The earth and its foundations quake. The sea rises up with waves from the deep, and its waves will be troubled, along with the fish in them, at the presence of the Lord, and before the glory of his power. For his right hand that bends the bow is strong, his arrows that he shoots are sharp, and will not miss when they begin to be shot into the ends of the world. Behold, the calamities are sent out, and will not return again until they come upon the earth. The fire is kindled and will not be put out until it consumes the foundations of the earth. Just as an arrow which is shot by a mighty archer doesn’t return backward, even so the calamities that are sent out upon earth won’t return again. Woe is me! Woe is me! Who will deliver me in those days?

The beginning of sorrows, when there will be great mourning; the beginning of famine, and many will perish; the beginning of wars, and the powers will stand in fear; the beginning of calamities, and all will tremble! What will they do when the calamities come? Behold, famine and plague, suffering and anguish! They are sent as scourges for correction. But for all these things they will not turn them from their wickedness, nor be always mindful of the scourges. Behold, food will be so cheap on earth that they will think themselves to be in good condition, and even then calamities will grow on earth: sword, famine, and great confusion. For many of those who dwell on earth will perish of famine; and others who escape the famine, the sword will destroy. The dead will be cast out like dung, and there will be no one to comfort them; for the earth will be left desolate, and its cities will be cast down. There will be no farmer left to cultivate the earth or to sow it. The trees will give fruit, but who will gather it? The grapes will ripen, but who will tread them? For in all places there will be a great solitude; for one man will desire to see another, or to hear his voice. For of a city there will be ten left, and two of the field, who have hidden themselves in the thick groves, and in the clefts of the rocks. As in an orchard of olives upon every tree there may be left three or four olives, or as when a vineyard is gathered, there are some clusters left by those who diligently search through the vineyard, even so in those days, there will be three or four left by those who search their houses with the sword. The earth will be left desolate, and its fields will be for briers, and its roads and all her paths will grow thorns, because no sheep will pass along them. The virgins will mourn, having no bridegrooms. The women will mourn, having no husbands. Their daughters will mourn, having no helpers. Their bridegrooms will be destroyed in the wars, and their husbands will perish of famine.

Hear now these things, and understand them, you servants of the Lord. Behold, the Lord’s word: receive it. Don’t doubt the things about which the Lord speaks. Behold, the calamities draw near, and are not delayed. Just as a woman with child in the ninth month, when the hour of her delivery draws near, within two or three hours great pains surround her womb, and when the child comes out from the womb, there will be no waiting for a moment, even so the calamities won’t delay coming upon the earth. The world will groan, and sorrows will seize it on every side.

“O my people, hear my word: prepare for battle, and in those calamities be like strangers on the earth. He who sells, let him be as he who flees away, and he who buys, as one who will lose. Let he who does business be as he who has no profit by it, and he who builds, as he who won’t dwell in it, and he who sows, as if he wouldn’t reap, so also he who prunes the vines, as he who won’t gather the grapes, those who marry, as those who will have no children, and those who don’t marry, as the widowed. Because of this, those who labor, labor in vain; for foreigners will reap their fruits, plunder their goods, overthrow their houses, and take their children captive, for in captivity and famine they will conceive their children. Those who conduct business, do so only to be plundered. The more they adorn their cities, their houses, their possessions, and their own persons, the more I will hate them for their sins,” says the Lord. Just as a respectable and virtuous woman hates a prostitute, so will righteousness hate iniquity, when she adorns herself, and will accuse her to her face, when he comes who will defend him who diligently searches out every sin on earth.

Therefore don’t be like her or her works. For yet a little while, and iniquity will be taken away out of the earth, and righteousness will reign over us. Don’t let the sinner say that he has not sinned; for God will burn coals of fire on the head of one who says “I haven’t sinned before God and his glory.” Behold, the Lord knows all the works of men, their imaginations, their thoughts, and their hearts. He said, “Let the earth be made,” and it was made, “Let the sky be made,” and it was made. At his word, the stars were established, and he knows the number of the stars. He searches the deep and its treasures. He has measured the sea and what it contains. He has shut the sea in the midst of the waters, and with his word, he hung the earth over the waters. He has spread out the sky like a vault. He has founded it over the waters. He has made springs of water in the desert and pools on the tops of the mountains to send out rivers from the heights to water the earth. He formed man, and put a heart in the midst of the body, and gave him breath, life, and understanding, yes, the spirit of God Almighty. He who made all things and searches out hidden things in hidden places, surely he knows your imagination, and what you think in your hearts. Woe to those who sin, and try to hide their sin! Because the Lord will exactly investigate all your works, and he will put you all to shame. When your sins are brought out before men, you will be ashamed, and your own iniquities will stand as your accusers in that day. What will you do? Or how will you hide your sins before God and his angels? Behold, God is the judge. Fear him! Stop sinning, and forget your iniquities, to never again commit them. So will God lead you out, and deliver you from all suffering.

For, behold, the burning wrath of a great multitude is kindled over you, and they will take away some of you, and feed you with that which is sacrificed to idols. Those who consent to them will be held in derision and in contempt, and be trodden under foot. For there will be in various places, and in the next cities, a great insurrection against those who fear the Lord. They will be like mad men, sparing none, but spoiling and destroying those who still fear the Lord. For they will destroy and plunder their goods, and throw them out of their houses. Then the trial of my elect will be made known, even as the gold that is tried in the fire. Hear, my elect ones, says the Lord: “Behold, the days of suffering are at hand, and I will deliver you from them. Don’t be afraid, and don’t doubt, for God is your guide. You who keep my commandments and precepts,” says the Lord God, “don’t let your sins weigh you down, and don’t let your iniquities lift themselves up.” Woe to those who are choked with their sins and covered with their iniquities, like a field is choked with bushes, and its path covered with thorns, that no one may travel through! It is shut off and given up to be consumed by fire.

## 4 Maccabees

The Fourth Book of the Maccabees appears in an appendix to the Greek Septuagint. It is considered to be apocrypha by most church traditions. It is preserved here for its supplementary historical value.

### Chapter 1

As I am going to demonstrate a most philosophical proposition, namely, that religious reasoning is absolute master of the emotions. I would willingly advise you to give the utmost heed to philosophy. For reason is necessary to everyone as a step to science. In addition, it embraces the praise of self-control, the highest virtue. If, then, reasoning appears to hold the mastery over the emotions which stand in the way of temperance, such as gluttony and lust, it surely also and manifestly rules over the affections which are contrary to justice, such as malice, and of those which are hindrances to courage, such as wrath, pain, and fear. Perhaps some may ask, “How is it, then, that reasoning, if it rules the emotions, isn’t also master of forgetfulness and ignorance?” They attempt a ridiculous argument. For reasoning does not rule over its own emotions, but over those that are contrary to justice, courage, temperance, and self-control; and yet over these, so as to withstand, without destroying them.

I might prove to you from many other considerations, that religious reasoning is sole master of the emotions; but I will prove it with the greatest force from the fortitude of Eleazar, and seven kindred, and their mother, who suffered death in defense of virtue. For all these, treating pains with contempt even to death, by this contempt, demonstrated that reasoning has command over the emotions. For their virtues, then, it is right that I should commend those men who died with their mother at this time on behalf of nobility and goodness; and for their honors, I may count them blessed. For they, winning admiration not only from men in general, but even from the persecutors, for their courage and endurance, became the means of the destruction of the tyranny against their nation, having conquered the tyrant by their endurance, so that by them their country was purified. But we may now at once enter upon the question, having commenced, as is our custom, with laying down the doctrine, and so proceed to the account of these people, giving glory to the all-wise God.

Therefore the question whether reasoning is absolute master of the emotions. Let’s determine, then, what reasoning is and what emotion is, and how many forms of emotion there are, and whether reasoning rules over all of these. Reasoning is intellect accompanied by a life of righteousness, putting foremost the consideration of wisdom. Wisdom is a knowledge of divine and human things, and of their causes. This is contained in the education of the law, by means of which we learn divine things reverently and human things profitably. The forms of wisdom are self-control, justice, courage, and temperance. The leading one of these is self-control, by whose means, indeed, it is that reasoning rules over the emotions. Of the emotions, pleasure and pain are the two most comprehensive; and they also by nature refer to the soul. There are many attendant affections surrounding pleasure and pain. Before pleasure is lust; and after pleasure, joy. Before pain is fear; and after pain is sorrow. Wrath is an affection, common to pleasure and to pain, if any one will pay attention when it comes upon him. There exists in pleasure a malicious disposition, which is the most complex of all the affections. In the soul, it is arrogance, love of money, thirst for honor, contention, faithlessness, and the evil eye. In the body, it is greediness, indiscriminate eating, and solitary gluttony.

As pleasure and pain are, therefore, two growths out of the body and the soul, so there are many offshoots of these emotions. Reasoning, the universal farmer, purging and pruning each of these, tying up, watering, and transplanting, in every way improves the materials of the morals and affections. For reasoning is the leader of the virtues, but it is the sole ruler of the emotions.

Observe then first, through the very things which stand in the way of temperance, that reasoning is absolute ruler of the emotions. Now temperance consists of a command over the lusts. But of the lusts, some belong to the soul and others to the body. Reasoning appears to rule over both. Otherwise, how is it that when urged on to forbidden meats, we reject the gratification which would come from them? Isn’t it because reasoning is able to command the appetites? I believe so. Hence it is, then, that when craving seafood, birds, four-footed animals, and all kinds of food which are forbidden to us by the law, we withhold ourselves through the mastery of reasoning. For the affections of our appetites are resisted by the temperate understanding, and bent back again, and all the impulses of the body are reined in by reasoning.

### Chapter 2

Is it any wonder? If the lusts of the soul, after participation with what is beautiful, are frustrated, on this ground, therefore, the temperate Joseph is praised in that by reasoning, he subdued, on reflection, the indulgence of the senses. For, although young, and ripe for sexual intercourse, he nullified by reasoning the stimulus of his emotions. It isn’t merely the stimulus of sensual indulgence, but that of every desire, that reasoning is able to master. For instance, the law says, “You shall not covet your neighbor’s wife, nor anything that belongs to your neighbor.” Now, then, since it is the law which has forbidden us to desire, I shall much the more easily persuade you, that reasoning is able to govern our lusts, just as it does the affections which are impediments to justice. Since in what way is a solitary eater, a glutton, and a drunkard reclaimed, unless it is clear that reasoning is lord of the emotions? Therefore, a man who regulates his course by the law, even if he is a lover of money, immediately puts pressure on his own disposition by lending to the needy without interest, and cancelling the debt on the seventh year. If a man is greedy, he is ruled by the law acting through reasoning, so that he doesn’t glean his harvest crops or vintage. In reference to other points we may perceive that it is reasoning that conquers his emotions. For the law conquers even affection toward parents, not surrendering virtue on their account. It prevails over love for one’s wife, rebuking her when she breaks the law. It lords it over the love of parents toward their children, for they punish them for vice. It domineers over the intimacy of friends, reproving them when wicked. Don’t think it is a strange assertion that reasoning can on behalf of the law conquer even enmity. It doesn’t allow cutting down the fruit trees of an enemy, but preserves them from the destroyers, and collects their fallen ruins. Reason appears to be master of the more violent emotions, like love of empire, empty boasting, and slander. For the temperate understanding repels all these malignant emotions, as it does wrath; for it masters even this. Thus Moses, when angered against Dathan and Abiram, did nothing to them in wrath, but regulated his anger by reasoning. For the temperate mind is able, as I said, to be superior to the emotions, and to correct some and destroy others. For why else did our most wise father Jacob blame Simeon and Levi for having irrationally slain the whole race of the Shechemites, saying, “Cursed be their anger!”? For if reasoning didn’t possess the power of subduing angry affections, he would not have said this. For at the time when God created man, he implanted within him his emotions and moral nature. At that time he enthroned the mind above all as the holy leader, through the medium of the senses. He gave a law to this mind, by living according to which it will maintain a temperate, just, good, and courageous reign. How, then, a man may say, if reasoning is master of the emotions, has it no control over forgetfulness and ignorance?

### Chapter 3

The argument is exceedingly ridiculous, for reasoning doesn’t appear to rule over its own affections, but over those of the body, in such a way as that any one of you may not be able to root out desire, but reasoning will enable you to avoid being enslaved to it. One may not be able to root out anger from the soul, but it is possible to withstand anger. Any one of you may not be able to eradicate malice, but reasoning has force to work with you to prevent you yielding to malice. For reasoning is not an eradicator, but an antagonist of the emotions.

This may be more clearly comprehended from the thirst of King David. For after David had been attacking the Philistines the whole day, he with the soldiers of his nation killed many of them; then when evening came, sweating and very weary, he came to the royal tent, around which the entire army of our ancestors was encamped. Now all the rest of them were at supper; but the king, being very much thirsty, although he had numerous springs, could not by their means quench his thirst; but a certain irrational longing for the water in the enemy’s camp grew stronger and fiercer upon him, undid and consumed him. Therefore his bodyguards being troubled at this longing of the king, two valiant young soldiers, respecting the desire of the king, fully armed themselves, and taking a pitcher, got over the ramparts of the enemies. Unperceived by the guardians of the gate, they went throughout the whole camp of the enemy in quest. Having boldly discovered the fountain, they filled out of it the drink for the king. But he, though parched with thirst, reasoned that a drink regarded of equal value to blood would be terribly dangerous to his soul. Therefore, setting up reasoning in opposition to his desire, he poured out the drink to God. For the temperate mind has power to conquer the pressure of the emotions, to quench the fires of excitement, and to wrestle down the pains of the body, however excessive, and through the excellency of reasoning, to spurn all the assaults of the emotions. But the occasion now invites us to give an illustration of temperate reasoning from history. For at a time when our fathers were in possession of undisturbed peace through obedience to the law and were prosperous, so that Seleucus Nicanor, the king of Asia, both assigned them money for divine service, and accepted their form of government, then certain people, bringing in new things contrary to the public harmony, in various ways fell into calamities.

### Chapter 4

For a certain man named Simon, who was in opposition to an honorable and good man who once held the high priesthood for life, named Onias. After slandering Onias in every way, Simon couldn’t injure him with the people, so he went away as an exile, with the intention of betraying his country. When coming to Apollonius, the military governor of Syria, Phoenicia, and Cilicia, he said, “Having good will to the king’s affairs, I have come to inform you that tens of thousands in private wealth is laid up in the treasuries of Jerusalem which do not belong to the temple, but belong to King Seleucus.” Apollonius, acquainting himself with the particulars of this, praised Simon for his care of the king’s interests, and going up to Seleucus informed him of the treasure. Getting authority about it, and quickly advancing into our country with the accursed Simon and a very heavy force, he said that he came with the commands of the king that he should take the private money of the treasury. The nation, indignant at this proclamation, and replying to the effect that it was extremely unfair that those who had committed deposits to the sacred treasury should be deprived of them, resisted as well as they could. But Appolonius went away with threats into the temple. The priests, with the women and children, asked God to throw his shield over the holy, despised place, and Appolonius was going up with his armed force to seize the treasure, when angels from heaven appeared riding on horseback, all radiant in armor, filling them with much fear and trembling. Apollonius fell half dead on the court which is open to all nations, and extended his hands to heaven, and implored the Hebrews, with tears, to pray for him, and take away the wrath of the heavenly army. For he said that he had sinned, so as to be consequently worthy of death, and that if he were saved, he would proclaim to all people the blessedness of the holy place. Onias the high priest, induced by these words, although for other reasons anxious that King Seleucus wouldn’t suppose that Apollonius was slain by human device and not by Divine punishment, prayed for him; and he being thus unexpectedly saved, departed to report to the king what had happened to him. But on the death of Seleucus the king, his son Antiochus Epiphanes succeeded to the kingdom—a terrible man of arrogant pride.

He, having deposed Onias from the high priesthood, appointed his brother Jason to be high priest, who had made a covenant, if he would give him this authority, to pay yearly three thousand six hundred and sixty talents. He committed to him the high priesthood and rulership over the nation. He both changed the manner of living of the people, and perverted their civil customs into all lawlessness. So that he not only erected a gymnasium on the very citadel of our country, but neglected the guardianship of the temple. Because of that, Divine vengeance was grieved and instigated Antiochus himself against them. For being at war with Ptolemy in Egypt, he heard that on a report of his death being spread abroad, the inhabitants of Jerusalem had exceedingly rejoiced, and he quickly marched against them. Having subdued them, he established a decree that if any of them lived according to the ancestral laws, he should die. When he could by no means destroy by his decrees the obedience to the law of the nation, but saw all his threats and punishments without effect, for even women, because they continued to circumcise their children, were flung down a precipice along with them, knowing beforehand of the punishment. When, therefore, his decrees were disregarded by the people, he himself compelled by means of tortures every one of this race, by tasting forbidden meats, to renounce the Jewish religion.

### Chapter 5

The tyrant Antiochus, therefore, sitting in public state with his assessors upon a certain lofty place, with his armed troops standing in a circle around him, commanded his spearbearers to seize every one of the Hebrews, and to compel them to taste swine’s flesh and things offered to idols. Should any of them be unwilling to eat the accursed food, they were to be tortured on the wheel and so killed. When many had been seized, a foremost man of the assembly, a Hebrew, by name Eleazar, a priest by family, by profession a lawyer, and advanced in years, and for this reason known to many of the king’s followers, was brought near to him.

Antiochus, seeing him, said, “I would counsel you, old man, before your tortures begin, to taste the swine’s flesh, and save your life; for I feel respect for your age and hoary head, which since you have had so long, you appear to me to be no philosopher in retaining the superstition of the Jews. For therefore, since nature has conferred upon you the most excellent flesh of this animal, do you loathe it? It seems senseless not to enjoy what is pleasant, yet not disgraceful; and from notions of sinfulness, to reject the gifts of nature. You will be acting, I think, still more senselessly, if you follow vain conceits about the truth. You will, moreover, be despising me to your own punishment. Won’t you awake from your trifling philosophy, give up the folly of your notions, and regaining understanding worthy of your age, search into the truth of an expedient course? Won’t you respect my kindly admonition and have pity on your own years? For bear in mind that if there is any power which watches over this religion of yours, it will pardon you for all transgressions of the law which you commit through compulsion.”

While the tyrant incited him in this manner to the unlawful eating of meat, Eleazar begged permission to speak. Having received permission to speak, he began to address the people as follows: “We, O Antiochus, who are persuaded that we live under a divine law, consider no compulsion to be so forcible as obedience to that law. Therefore we consider that we ought not to transgress the law in any way. Indeed, were our law (as you suppose) not truly divine, and if we wrongly think it divine, we would have no right even in that case to destroy our sense of religion. Don’t think that eating unclean meat is a trifling offense. For transgression of the law, whether in small or great matters, is of equal importance; for in either case the law is equally slighted. But you deride our philosophy, as though we lived in it irrationally. Yet it instructs us in self-control, so that we are superior to all pleasures and lusts; and it trains us in courage, so that we cheerfully undergo every grievance. It instructs us in justice, so that in all our dealings we render what is due. It teaches us piety, so that we properly worship the one and only God. That is why we don’t eat the unclean; for believing that the law was established by God, we are convinced that the Creator of the world, in giving his laws, sympathizes with our nature. Those things which are suitable for our souls, he has directed us to eat; but those which are not, he has forbidden. But, tyrant-like, you not only force us to break the law, but also to eat, that you may ridicule us as we thus profanely eat. But you won’t have this cause of laughter against me, nor will I transgress the sacred oaths of my forefathers to keep the law. No, not if you pluck out my eyes, and consume my entrails. I am not so old, and void of courage as to not be youthful in reason and in defense of my religion. Now then, prepare your wheels, and kindle a fiercer flame. I will not so pity my old age, as on my account to break the law of my country. I will not play false to you, O law, my instructor, or forsake you, O beloved self-control! I will not put you to shame, O philosopher Reason, or deny you, O honored priesthood and knowledge of the law. Mouth! You shall not pollute my old age, nor the full stature of a perfect life. My ancestors will receive me as pure, not having feared your compulsion, even to death. For you will rule like a tyrant over the ungodly, but you will not lord it over my thoughts about religion, either by your arguments, or through deeds.”

### Chapter 6

When Eleazar had in this manner answered the exhortations of the tyrant, the spearbearers came up, and rudely dragged Eleazar to the instruments of torture. First, they stripped the old man, adorned as he was with the beauty of piety. Then tying back his arms and hands, they disdainfully flogged him. A herald opposite cried out, “Obey the commands of the king!”

But the high-minded and truly noble Eleazar, as one tortured in a dream, ignored it. But raising his eyes on high to heaven, the old man’s flesh was stripped off by the scourges, and his blood streamed down, and his sides were pierced through. Falling on the ground from his body having no power to endure the pains, he still kept his reasoning upright and unbending. Then one of the harsh spearbearers rushed at him and began to kick him in the side to force him to get up again after he fell. But he endured the pains, despised the cruelty, and persevered through the indignities. Like a noble athlete, the old man, when struck, vanquished his torturers. His face sweating, and he panting for breath, he was admired even by the torturers for his courage.

Therefore, partly in pity for his old age, partly from the sympathy of acquaintance, and partly in admiration of his endurance, some of the attendants of the king said, “Why do you unreasonably destroy yourself, O Eleazar, with these miseries? We will bring you some meat cooked by yourself, and you can save yourself by pretending that you have eaten swine’s flesh.”

Eleazar, as though the advice more painfully tortured him, cried out, “Let us who are children of Abraham not be so evil advised as by giving way to make use of an unbecoming pretense. For it would be irrational, if having lived up to old age in all truth, and having scrupulously guarded our character for it, we would now turn back and ourselves become a pattern of impiety to the young, as being an example of eating pollution. It would be disgraceful if we would live on some short time, and that scorned by all men for cowardice, and be condemned by the tyrant for cowardice by not contending to the death for our divine law. Therefore you, O children of Abraham, die nobly for your religion. You spearbearers of the tyrant, why do you linger?”

Beholding him so high-minded against misery, and not changing at their pity, they led him to the fire. Then with their wickedly contrived instruments they burned him on the fire, and poured stinking fluids down into his nostrils.

He being at length burned down to the bones, and about to expire, raised his eyes Godward, and said, “You know, O God, that when I might have been saved, I am slain for the sake of the law by tortures of fire. Be merciful to your people, and be satisfied with the punishment of me on their account. Let my blood be a purification for them, and take my life in exchange for theirs.” Thus speaking, the holy man departed, noble in his torments, and even to the agonies of death resisted in his reasoning for the sake of the law. Confessedly, therefore, religious reasoning is master of the emotions. For had the emotions been superior to reasoning, I would have given them the witness of this mastery. But now, since reasoning conquered the emotions, we befittingly award it the authority of first place. It is only fair that we should allow that the power belongs to reasoning, since it masters external miseries. It would be ridiculous if it weren’t so. I prove that reasoning has not only mastered pains, but that it is also superior to the pleasures, and withstands them.

### Chapter 7

The reasoning of our father Eleazar, like a first-rate pilot, steering the vessel of piety in the sea of emotions, and flouted by the threats of the tyrant, and overwhelmed with the breakers of torture, in no way shifted the rudder of piety until it sailed into the harbor of victory over death. No besieged city has ever held out against many and various war machines as that holy man did when his pious soul was tried with the fiery trial of tortures and rackings and moved his besiegers through the religious reasoning that shielded him. For father Eleazar, projecting his disposition, broke the raging waves of the emotions as with a jutting cliff. O priest worthy of the priesthood! You didn’t pollute your sacred teeth, nor make your appetite, which had always embraced the clean and lawful, a partaker of profanity. O harmonizer with the law, and sage devoted to a divine life! Of such a character ought those to be who perform the duties of the law at the risk of their own blood, and defend it with generous sweat by sufferings even to death. You, father, have gloriously established our right government by your endurance; and making of much account our past service, prevented its destruction, and by your deeds, have made credible the words of philosophy. O aged man of more power than tortures, elder more vigorous than fire, greatest king over the emotions, Eleazar! For as father Aaron, armed with a censer, hastening through the consuming fire, vanquished the flame-bearing angel, so, Eleazar, the descendant of Aaron, wasted away by the fire, didn’t give up his reasoning. What is most wonderful is that though he was an old man, though the labors of his body were now spent, his muscles were relaxed, and his sinews worn out, he recovered youth. By the spirit of reasoning, and the reasoning of Isaac, he rendered powerless the many-headed rack. O blessed old age, and reverend hoar head, and life obedient to the law, which the faithful seal of death perfected. If, then, an old man, through religion, despised tortures even to death, then certainly religious reasoning is ruler of the emotions. But perhaps some might say, “It is not all who conquer emotions, as not all possess wise reasoning.” But those who have meditated upon religion with their whole heart, these alone can master the emotions of the flesh: they who believe that to God they don’t die; for, as our forefathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, they live to God. This circumstance, then, is by no means an objection, that some who have weak reasoning are governed by their emotions, since what person, walking religiously by the whole rule of philosophy, and believing in God, and knowing that it is a blessed thing to endure all kinds of hardships for virtue, would not, for the sake of religion, master his emotion? For only the wise and brave man is lord over his emotions. This is why even boys, trained with the philosophy of religious reasoning, have conquered still more bitter tortures; for when the tyrant was manifestly vanquished in his first attempt, in being unable to force the old man to eat the unclean thing,

### Chapter 8

then, indeed, vehemently swayed with emotion, he commanded to bring others of the adult Hebrews, and if they would eat of the unclean thing, to let them go when they had eaten; but if they objected, to torment them more grievously. The tyrant having given this charge, seven kindred were brought into his presence, along with their aged mother. They were handsome, modest, well-born, and altogether comely. When the tyrant saw them encircling their mother as in a dance, he was pleased with them. Being struck with their becoming and innocent manner, smiled at them, and calling them near, said, “O youths, with favorable feelings, I admire the beauty of each of you. Greatly honouring so numerous a band of kindred, I not only counsel you not to share the madness of the old man who has been tortured before, but I beg you to yield, and to enjoy my friendship; for I possess the power, not only of punishing those who disobey my commands, but of doing good to those who obey them. Put confidence in me, then, and you will receive places of authority in my government, if you forsake your national way of life, and, conforming to the Greek way of life, alter your rule and revel in youth’s delights. For if you provoke me by your disobedience, you will compel me to destroy every one of you with terrible punishments by tortures. Have mercy, then, upon your own selves, whom I, although an enemy, am compassionate for your age and attractive appearance. Won’t you consider this: that if you disobey, there will be nothing left for you but to die in torture?”

When he had said this, he ordered the instruments of torture to be brought forward, that fear might prevail upon them to eat unclean meat. When the spearman brought forward the wheels, the racks, the hooks, racks, caldrons, pans, finger-racks, iron hands and wedges, and bellows, the tyrant continued: “Fear, young men, and the righteousness which you worship will be merciful to you if you transgress because of compulsion.”

Now they having listened to these words of persuasion, and seeing the fearful instruments, not only were not afraid, but even answered the arguments of the tyrant, and through their good reasoning destroyed his power. Now let’s consider the matter. Had any of them been weak-spirited and cowardly among them, what reasoning would they have employed but these? “O wretched that we are, and exceedingly senseless! When the king exhorts us, and calls us to his bounty, should we not obey him? Why do we cheer ourselves with vain counsels, and venture upon a disobedience bringing death? Shall we not fear, O kindred, the instruments of torture and weigh the threatenings of torment and shun this vain-glory and destructive pride? Let’s have compassion upon our age and relent over the years of our mother. Let’s bear in mind that we will be dying as rebels. Divine Justice will pardon us if we fear the king through necessity. Why withdraw ourselves from a most sweet life, and deprive ourselves of this pleasant world? Let’s not oppose necessity, nor seek vain-glory by our own torture. The law itself wouldn’t arbitrarily put us to death because we dread torture. Why has such angry zeal taken root in us, and such fatal obstinacy approved itself to us, when we might live unmolested by the king?”

But the young men didn’t say or think anything of this kind when about to be tortured. For they were well aware of the sufferings, and masters of the pains. - So that as soon as the tyrant had ceased counselling them to eat the unclean, they all with one voice, as from the same heart said,

### Chapter 9

“Why do you delay, O tyrant? For we are more ready to die than to transgress the injunctions of our fathers. We would be disgracing our fathers if we didn’t obey the law, and take knowledge for our guide. O tyrant, counselor of law-breaking, do not, hating us as you do, pity us more than we pity ourselves. For we consider your escape to be worse than death. You try to scare us by threatening us with death by tortures, as though you had learned nothing by the death of Eleazar. But if aged men of the Hebrews have died in the cause of religion after enduring torture, more rightly should we younger men die, scorning your cruel tortures, which our aged instructor overcame. Make the attempt, then, O tyrant. If you put us to death for our religion, don’t think that you harm us by torturing us. For we through this ill-treatment and endurance will gain the rewards of virtue. But you, for the wicked and despotic slaughter of us, will, from the Divine vengeance, endure eternal torture by fire.”

When they had said this, the tyrant was not only exasperated against them for being disobedient, but enraged with them for being ungrateful. So, at his bidding, the torturers brought the oldest of them, and tearing through his tunic, bound his hands and arms on each side with thongs. When they had labored hard without effect in scourging him, they hurled him on the wheel. The noble youth, extended upon this, became dislocated. With every member disjointed, he denounced the tyrant, saying, “O most accursed tyrant, and enemy of heavenly justice, and cruel-hearted, I am no murderer, nor sacrilegious man, whom you torture, but a defender of the Divine law.”

And when the spearmen said, “Consent to eat, that you may be released from your tortures,” he answered, “Not so powerful, O accursed lackeys, is your wheel, as to stifle my reasoning. Cut my limbs, and burn my flesh, and twist my joints. For through all my torments I will convince you that the children of the Hebrews are alone unconquered on behalf of virtue.”

While he was saying this, they heaped up fuel, and setting fire to it, strained him on the wheel still more. The wheel was defiled all over with blood. The hot ashes were quenched by the droppings of gore, and pieces of flesh were scattered about the axles of the machine. Although the framework of his bones was now destroyed, the high-minded and Abrahamic youth didn’t groan. But, as though transformed by fire into immortality, he nobly endured the rackings, saying, “Imitate me, O kindred. Never desert your station, nor renounce my brotherhood in courage. Fight the holy and honorable fight of religion, by which means our just and paternal Providence, becoming merciful to the nation, will punish the pestilent tyrant.” Saying this, the revered youth abruptly closed his life.

When all admired his courageous soul, the spearmen brought forward him who was second oldest, and having put on iron gauntlets with sharp hooks, bound him to the rack. When, on enquiring whether he would eat before he was tortured, they heard his noble sentiment. After they with the iron gauntlets had violently dragged all the flesh from the neck to the chin, the panther-like animals tore off the very skin of his head, but he, bearing with firmness this misery, said, “How sweet is every form of death for the religion of our fathers!” Then he said to the tyrant, “Don’t you think, most cruel of all tyrants, that you are now tortured more than I, finding your arrogant conception of tyranny conquered by our perseverance in behalf of our religion? For I lighten my suffering by the pleasures which are connected with virtue. But you are tortured with threatenings for impiety. You won’t escape, most corrupt tyrant, the vengeance of Divine wrath.”

### Chapter 10

Now this one endured this praiseworthy death. The third was brought along, and exhorted by many to taste and save his life. But he cried out and said, “Don’t you know that the father of those who are dead is my father also, and that the same mother bore me, and that I was brought up in the same way? I don’t renounce the noble relationship of my kindred. Now then, whatever instrument of vengeance you have, apply it to my body, for you aren’t able to touch my soul, even if you want to.” But they, highly incensed at his boldness of speech, dislocated his hands and feet with racking engines, and wrenching them from their sockets, dismembered him. They dragged around his fingers, his arms, his legs, and his ankles. Not being able by any means to strangle him, they tore off his skin, together with the extreme tips of his fingers, and then dragged him to the wheel, around which his vertebral joints were loosened, and he saw his own flesh torn to shreds, and streams of blood flowing from his entrails. When about to die, he said, “We, O accursed tyrant, suffer this for the sake of Divine education and virtue. But you, for your impiety and blood shedding, will endure unceasing torments.”

Thus having died worthily of his kindred, they dragged forward the fourth, saying, “Don’t share the madness of your kindred, but respect the king and save yourself.”

But he said to them, “You don’t have a fire so scorching as to make me play the coward. By the blessed death of my kindred, and the eternal punishment of the tyrant, and the glorious life of the pious, I will not repudiate the noble brotherhood. Invent, O tyrant, tortures, that you may learn, even through them, that I am the brother of those tormented before.”

When he had said this, the blood-thirsty, murderous, and unholy Antiochus ordered his tongue to be cut out. But he said, “Even if you take away the organ of speech, God still hears the silent. Behold, my tongue is extended, cut it off; for in spite of that you won’t silence our reasoning. We gladly lose our limbs on behalf of God. But God will speedily find you, since you cut off the tongue, the instrument of divine melody.”

### Chapter 11

When he had died, disfigured in his torments, the fifth leaped forward, and said, “I don’t intend, O tyrant, to get excused from the torment which is on behalf of virtue. But I have come of my own accord, that by my death you may owe heavenly vengeance and punishment for more crimes. O you hater of virtue and of men, what have we done that you thus revel in our blood? Does it seem evil to you that we worship the Founder of all things, and live according to his surpassing law? But this is worthy of honors, not torments, if you had been capable of the higher feelings of men, and possessed the hope of salvation from God. Behold now, being alien from God, you make war against those who are religious toward God.”

As he said this, the spearbearers bound him and drew him to the rack, to which binding him at his knees, and fastening them with iron fetters, they bent down his loins upon the wedge of the wheel; and his body was then dismembered, scorpion-fashion. With his breath thus confined, and his body strangled, he said, “A great favor you bestow upon us, O tyrant, by enabling us to manifest our adherence to the law by means of nobler sufferings.”

He also being dead, the sixth, quite a youth, was brought out. On the tyrant asking him whether he would eat and be delivered, he said, “I am indeed younger than my brothers, but in understanding I am as old; for having been born and reared to the same end. We are bound to die also on behalf of the same cause. So that if you think it is proper to torment us for not eating the unclean, then torment!”

As he said this, they brought him to the wheel. Extended upon this, with limbs racked and dislocated, he was gradually roasted from beneath. Having heated sharp spits, they approached them to his back; and having transfixed his sides, they burned away his entrails. He, while tormented, said, “O good and holy contest, in which for the sake of religion, we kindred have been called to the arena of pain, and have not been conquered. For religious understanding, O tyrant, is unconquered. Armed with upright virtue, I also will depart with my kindred. I, too, bearing with me a great avenger, O inventor of tortures, and enemy of the truly pious. We six youths have destroyed your tyranny. For isn’t your inability to overrule our reasoning, and to compel us to eat the unclean, your destruction? Your fire is cold to us. Your racks are painless, and your violence harmless. For the guards not of a tyrant but of a divine law are our defenders. Through this we keep our reasoning unconquered.”

### Chapter 12

When he, too, had undergone blessed martyrdom, and died in the cauldron into which he had been thrown, the seventh, the youngest of all, came forward, whom the tyrant pitying, though he had been dreadfully reproached by his kindred, seeing him already encompassed with chains, had him brought nearer, and endeavored to counsel him, saying, “You see the end of the madness of your kindred, for they have died in torture through disobedience. You, if disobedient, having been miserably tormented, will yourself perish prematurely. But if you obey, you will be my friend, and have a charge over the affairs of the kingdom.” Having thus exhorted him, he sent for the boy’s mother, that, by showing compassion to her for the loss of so many sons, he might incline her, through the hope of safety, to render the survivor obedient.

He, after his mother had urged him on in the Hebrew tongue, (as we will soon relate) said, “Release me that I may speak to the king and all his friends.” They, rejoicing exceedingly at the promise of the youth, quickly let him go. He, running up to the pans, said, “Impious tyrant, and most blasphemous man, were you not ashamed, having received prosperity and a kingdom from God, to kill His servants, and to rack the doers of godliness? Therefore the divine vengeance is reserving you for eternal fire and torments, which will cling to you for all time. Weren’t you ashamed, man as you are, yet most savage, to cut out the tongues of men of like feeling and origin, and having thus abused to torture them? But they, bravely dying, fulfilled their religion toward God. But you will groan as you deserve for having slain without cause the champions of virtue. Therefore,” he continued, “I myself, being about to die, will not forsake my kindred. I call upon the God of my fathers to be merciful to my race. But you, both living and dead, he will punish.” Thus having prayed, he hurled himself into the pans; and so expired.

### Chapter 13

If then, the seven kindred despised troubles even to death, it is admitted on all sides that righteous reasoning is absolute master over the emotions. For just as if they had eaten of the unholy as slaves to the emotions, we would have said that they had been conquered by them. Now it is not so. But by means of the reasoning which is praised by God, they mastered their emotions. It is impossible to overlook the leadership of reflection, for it gained the victory over both emotions and troubles. How, then, can we avoid according to these men mastery of emotion through right reasoning, since they didn’t withdraw from the pains of fire? For just as by means of towers projecting in front of harbors men break the threatening waves, and thus assure a still course to vessels entering port, so that seven-towered right-reasoning of the young men, securing the harbour of religion, conquered the tempest of emotions. For having arranged a holy choir of piety, they encouraged one another, saying, “Brothers, may we die brotherly for the law. Let us imitate the three young men in Assyria who despised the equally afflicting furnace. Let’s not be cowards in the manifestation of piety.” One said, “Courage, brother!” and another, “Nobly endure!” Another said, “Remember of what stock you are;” and by the hand of our father Isaac endured to be slain for the sake of piety. One and all, looking at each other serene and confident, said, “Let’s sacrifice with all our heart our souls to God who gave them, and employ our bodies for the keeping of the law. Let’s not fear him who thinks he kills; for great is the trial of soul and danger of eternal torment laid up for those who transgress the commandment of God. Let’s arm ourselves, therefore, in the self-control, which is divine reasoning. If we suffer like this, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob will receive us, and all the fathers will commend us. As each one of the kindred was hauled away, the rest exclaimed, “Don’t disgrace us, O brother, nor falsify those who died before you!”

Now you are not ignorant of the charm of brotherhood, which the Divine and all wise Providence has imparted through fathers to children, and has engendered through the mother’s womb. In which these brothers having remained an equal time, and having been formed for the same period, and been increased by the same blood, and having been perfected through the same principle of life, and having been brought forth at equal intervals, and having sucked milk from the same springs, hence their brotherly souls are reared up lovingly together, and increase the more powerfully by reason of this simultaneous rearing, and by daily companionship, and by other education, and exercise in the law of God.

Brotherly love being thus sympathetically constituted, the seven kindred had a more sympathetic mutual harmony. For being educated in the same law, and practicing the same virtues, and reared up in a just course of life, they increased this harmony with each other. For the same ardor for what is right and honorable increased their goodwill and harmony toward each other. For it acting along with religion, made their brotherly feeling more desirable to them. And yet, although nature, companionship, and virtuous morals increased their brotherly love, those who were left endured to see their kindred, who were mistreated for their religion, tortured even to death.

### Chapter 14

More that this, they even urged them on to this mistreatment; so that they not only despised pains themselves, but they even got the better of their affections of brotherly love. Reasoning is more royal than a king, and freer than freemen! What a sacred and harmonious concert of the seven kindred as concerning piety! None of the seven youths turned cowardly or shrank back from death. But all of them, as though running the road to immortality, hastened on to death through tortures. For just as hands and feet are moved sympathetically with the directions of the soul, so those holy youths agreed to death for religion’s sake, as through the immortal soul of religion. O holy seven of harmonious kindred! For as the seven days of creation, about religion, so the youths, circling around the number seven, annulled the fear of torments. We now shudder at the recital of the affliction of those young men; but they not only saw, and not only heard the immediate execution of the threat, but undergoing it, persevered; and that through the pains of fire. What could be more painful? For the power of fire, being sharp and quick, speedily dissolved their bodies. Don’t think it wonderful that reasoning ruled over those men in their torments, when even a woman’s mind despised more manifold pains. For the mother of those seven youths endured the rackings of each of her children.

Consider how comprehensive is the love of offspring, which draws every one to sympathy of affection, where irrational animals possess a similar sympathy and love for their offspring with men. The tame birds frequenting the roofs of our houses defend their fledglings. Others build their nests, and hatch their young, on the tops of mountains and in the precipices of valleys, and the holes and tops of trees, and keep away the intruder. If not able to do this, they fly circling round them in agony of affection, calling out in their own note, and save their offspring in whatever manner they are able. But why should we point attention to the sympathy toward children shown by irrational animals? Even bees, at the season of honey-making, attack all who approach, and pierce with their sting, as with a sword, those who draw near their hive, and repel them even to death. But sympathy with her children didn’t turn away the mother of the young men, who had a spirit kindred with that of Abraham.

### Chapter 15

O reasoning of the sons, lord over the emotions, and religion more desirable to a mother than children! The mother, when two things were set before her, religion and the safety of her seven sons for a time, on the conditional promise of a tyrant, rather elected the religion which according to God preserves to eternal life. In what way can I describe ethically the affections of parents toward their children, the resemblance of soul and of form impressed into the small type of a child in a wonderful manner, especially through the greater sympathy of mothers with the feelings of those born of them! For by how much mothers are by nature weak in disposition and prolific in offspring, by so much the fonder they are of children. Of all mothers, the mother of the seven was the fondest of children, who in seven childbirths had deeply engendered love toward them. Through her many pains undergone in connection with each one, she was compelled to feel sympathy with them; yet, through fear of God, she neglected the temporary salvation of her children. Not only so, but on account of the excellent disposition to the law, her maternal affection toward them was increased. For they were both just and temperate, and courageous, high-minded, fond of their kindred, and so fond of their mother that even to death they obeyed her by observing the law.

Yet, though there were so many circumstances connected with love of children to draw on a mother to sympathy, in the case of none of them were the various tortures able to pervert her principle. But she inclined each one separately and all together to death for religion. O holy nature and parental feeling, and reward of bringing up children, and unconquerable maternal affection! At the racking and roasting of each one of them, the observant mother was prevented by religion from changing. She saw her children’s flesh dissolving around the fire, and their extremities quivering on the ground, and the flesh of their heads dropped forward down to their beards, like masks.

O you mother, who was tried at this time with bitterer pangs than those at birth! O you only woman who have produced perfect holiness! Your firstborn, expiring, didn’t turn you, nor the second, looking miserable in his torments, nor the third, breathing out his soul. You didn’t weep when you saw each of their eyes looking sternly at their tortures, and their nostrils foreboding death! When you saw children’s flesh heaped upon children’s flesh that had been torn off, heads decapitated upon heads, dead falling upon the dead, and a choir of children turned through torture into a burying ground, you didn’t lament. Not so do siren melodies or songs of swans attract the hearers to listening, O voices of children calling on your mother in the midst of torments! With what and what manner of torments was the mother herself tortured, as her sons were undergoing the wheel and the fires! But religious reasoning, having strengthened her courage in the midst of sufferings, enabled her to forego, for the time, parental love.

Although seeing the destruction of seven children, the noble mother, after one embrace, stripped off her feelings through faith in God. For just as in a council room, seeing in her own soul vehement counselors, nature and parentage and love of her children, and the racking of her children, she holding two votes, one for the death, the other for the preservation of her children, didn’t lean to that which would have saved her children for the safety of a brief space. But this daughter of Abraham remembered his holy fortitude.

O holy mother of a nation, avenger of the law, defender of religion, and prime bearer in the battle of the affections! O you nobler in endurance than males, and more courageous than men in perseverance! For like Noah’s ship, bearing the world in the world-filling flood, bore up against the waves, so you, the guardian of the law, when surrounded on every side by the flood of emotions, and assaulted by violent storms which were the torments of your children, bore up nobly against the storms against religion.

### Chapter 16

If, then, even a woman, and that an aged one, and the mother of seven children, endured to see her children’s torments even to death, it must be admitted that religious reasoning is master even of the emotions. I have proved, then, that not only men have obtained the mastery of their emotions, but also that a woman despised the greatest torments. The lions around Daniel were not so fierce, nor the furnace of Misael burning with most vehement fires as that natural love of children burned within her, when she saw her seven sons tortured. But with the reasoning of religion the mother quenched emotions so great and powerful. For we must consider also this: that, had the woman been faint hearted, as being their mother, she would have lamented over them, and perhaps might have spoken thus: “Ah! I am wretched and many times miserable, who having born seven sons, have become the mother of none. O seven useless childbirths, and seven profitless periods of labor, and fruitless givings of suck, and miserable nursings at the breast. Vainly, for your sakes, O sons, have I endured many pangs, and the more difficult anxieties of rearing. Alas, of my children, some of you unmarried, and some who have married to no profit, I will not see your children, nor have the joy of being a grandmother. Ah, that I who had many and fair children, should be a lone widow full of sorrows! Nor, should I die, will I have a son to bury me.” But with such a lament as this, the holy and God-fearing mother wept for none of them. Nor did she divert any of them from death, nor grieve for them as for the dead. But as one possessed with an adamant mind, and as one bringing forth again her full number of sons to immortality, she rather urged them to death on behalf of religion. O woman, soldier of God for religion, you, aged and a female, have conquered through endurance even a tyrant; and even though weak, have been found more powerful in deeds and words. For when you were seized along with your children, you stood looking at Eleazar in torture, and said to your sons in the Hebrew tongue, “O sons, the contest is noble, to which you being called as a witness for the nation, strive zealously for the laws of your country. For it would be disgraceful if this old man endured pains for the sake of righteousness, and that you who are younger would be afraid of the tortures. Remember that through God, you obtained existence and have enjoyed it. Therefore, you ought to bear every affliction because of God. For him also our father Abraham was zealous to sacrifice Isaac our progenitor, and didn’t shudder at the sight of his own paternal hand descending down with the sword upon him. The righteous Daniel was cast to the lions; and Ananias, Azarias, and Misael were hurled into a fiery furnace, yet they endured through God. You, then, having the same faith toward God, don’t be troubled. For it is unreasonable that they who know religion wouldn’t stand up against troubles. With these arguments, the mother of seven, exhorting each of her sons, encouraged and persuaded them not to transgress God’s commandment. They saw this, too, that those who die for God, live to God, like Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and all the patriarchs.

### Chapter 17

Some of the spearbearers said that when she herself was about to be seized for the purpose of being put to death, she threw herself on the pile, rather than let them touch her body. O you mother, who together with seven children destroyed the violence of the tyrant, and rendered void his wicked intentions, and exhibited the nobleness of faith! For you, like a house bravely built on the pillar of your children, bore the shock of tortures without swaying. Cheer up, therefore, O holy-minded mother! Hold the firm hope of your steadfastness with God. Not so gracious does the moon appear with the stars in heaven, as you are established as honorable before God, and fixed in the sky with your sons whom you illuminated with religion to the stars. For your bearing of children was after the manner of a child of Abraham.

If it were lawful for us to paint as on a tablet the religion of your story, the spectators wouldn’t shudder at seeing the mother of seven children enduring for the sake of religion various tortures even to death. It would have been a worthwhile thing to have inscribed on the tomb itself these words as a memorial to those of the nation, “Here an aged priest, and an aged woman, and seven sons, are buried through the violence of a tyrant, who wished to destroy the society of the Hebrews. These also avenged their nation, looking to God, and enduring torments to death.” For it was truly a divine contest which was carried through by them. For at that time virtue presided over the contest, approving the victory through endurance, namely, immortality, eternal life. Eleazar was the first to contend. The mother of the seven children entered the contest, and the kindred contended. The tyrant was the antagonist; and the world and living men were the spectators. Reverence for God conquered, and crowned her own athletes. Who didn’t admire those champions of true legislation? Who were not amazed? The tyrant himself, and all their council, admired their endurance, through which, they also now stand beside the divine throne and live a blessed life. For Moses says, “All the saints are under your hands.” These, therefore, having been sanctified through God, have been honored not only with this honor, but that also by the fact that because of them, the enemy didn’t overcome our nation. That tyrant was punished and their country purified. For they became the ransom to the sin of the nation. The Divine Providence saved Israel, which was afflicted before, by the blood of those pious ones and the death that appeased wrath. For the tyrant Antiochus, looking to their courageous virtue and to their endurance in torture, proclaimed that endurance as an example to his soldiers. They proved to be to him noble and brave for land battles and for sieges; and he conquered and stormed the towns of all his enemies.

### Chapter 18

O Israelite children, descendants of the seed of Abraham, obey this law and in every way be religious, knowing that religious reasoning is lord of the emotions, and those not only inward but outward.

Therefore those people who gave up their bodies to pains for the sake of religion were not only admired by men, but were deemed worthy of a divine portion. The nation through them obtained peace, and having renewed the observance of the law in their country, drove the enemy out of the land. The tyrant Antiochus was both punished on earth, and is punished now that he is dead; for when he was quite unable to compel the Israelites to adopt foreign customs, and to desert the manner of life of their fathers, then, departing from Jerusalem, he made war against the Persians. The righteous mother of the seven children spoke also as follows to her offspring: “I was a pure virgin, and didn’t go beyond my father’s house, but I took care of the rib from which woman was made. No destroyer of the desert or ravisher of the plain injured me, nor did the destructive, deceitful snake make plunder of my chaste virginity. I remained with my husband during the time of my maturity. When these, my children, arrived at maturity, their father died. He was blessed! For having sought out a life of fertility in children, he was not grieved with a period of loss of children. He used to teach you, when yet with you, the law and the prophets. He used to read to you about the slaying of Abel by Cain, the offering up of Isaac, and the imprisonment of Joseph. He used to tell you of the zealous Phinehas, and informed you of Ananias, Azarias, and Misael in the fire. He used to glorify Daniel, who was in the den of lions, and pronounce him blessed. He used to remind you of the scripture of Esaias, which says, “Even if you pass through the fire, it won’t burn you.” He chanted to you David, the hymn writer, who says, “Many are the afflictions of the just.” He declared the proverbs of Solomon, who says, “He is a tree of life to all those who do His will.” He used to confirm what Ezekiel said: “Will these dry bones live?” For he didn’t forget the song which Moses taught, proclaiming, “I will kill, and I will make alive.” This is our life and the length of our days.

O that bitter, and yet not bitter, day when the bitter tyrant of the Greeks, quenching fire with fire in his cruel caldrons, brought with boiling rage the seven sons of the daughter of Abraham to the rack, and to all his torments! He pierced the balls of their eyes, and cut out their tongues, and put them to death with varied tortures. Therefore divine retribution pursued and will pursue the pestilent wretch. But the children of Abraham, with their victorious mother, are assembled together to the choir of their father, having received pure and immortal souls from God. To him be glory forever and ever. Amen.
