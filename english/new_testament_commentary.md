# New Testament Commentary

## Matthew

### Chapter 1

Matthew chapter 1 is the opening chapter of the Gospel of Matthew in the New Testament. This chapter serves several important purposes and contains key elements of the Christian faith. Let's break down the chapter and explore its significance:

### Genealogy of Jesus

The chapter begins with a detailed genealogy of Jesus Christ, tracing His lineage from Abraham to Joseph, Mary's husband. This genealogy serves several purposes:

1. Establishes Jesus' Jewish heritage: By tracing Jesus' lineage back to Abraham, the father of the Jewish people, Matthew emphasizes Jesus' connection to the Jewish faith and traditions.
2. Highlights Jesus' royal lineage: The genealogy includes King David, emphasizing Jesus' claim to the throne of David and His fulfillment of messianic prophecies.
3. Demonstrates God's faithfulness: The genealogy shows how God kept His promises to Abraham and David over many generations.
4. Includes women and Gentiles: The inclusion of women (Tamar, Rahab, Ruth, and Bathsheba) and Gentiles in the genealogy demonstrates God's inclusive plan of salvation.

### Structure of the Genealogy

Matthew organizes the genealogy into three sets of fourteen generations:

1. From Abraham to David
2. From David to the Babylonian exile
3. From the Babylonian exile to Jesus

This structure may have been used for memorization purposes or to emphasize certain theological points.

### The Birth of Jesus

The chapter then transitions to the story of Jesus' birth, focusing on Joseph's perspective. Key elements include:

1. Mary's miraculous conception: Mary is found to be pregnant through the Holy Spirit before she and Joseph have consummated their marriage.
2. Joseph's dilemma: As a righteous man, Joseph plans to divorce Mary quietly to avoid public shame.
3. Divine intervention: An angel appears to Joseph in a dream, explaining the miraculous nature of Mary's pregnancy and instructing him to take Mary as his wife.
4. Fulfillment of prophecy: Matthew quotes Isaiah 7:14, connecting Jesus' birth to Old Testament prophecies about the Messiah.
5. The naming of Jesus: The angel instructs Joseph to name the child Jesus, explaining that He will save His people from their sins.

### Theological Significance

This chapter establishes several important theological points:

1. Jesus as the Messiah: By tracing Jesus' lineage and connecting His birth to Old Testament prophecies, Matthew presents Jesus as the long-awaited Messiah.
2. Virgin birth: The chapter affirms the doctrine of the virgin birth, emphasizing Jesus' divine nature.
3. God's plan of salvation: The genealogy and birth narrative demonstrate God's long-term plan for human salvation, culminating in Jesus.
4. Jesus' humanity and divinity: The chapter presents Jesus as both fully human (through His genealogy) and fully divine (through His miraculous conception).

In conclusion, Matthew chapter 1 serves as a powerful introduction to the Gospel, establishing Jesus' identity as the Messiah, His connection to Jewish history, and the miraculous nature of His birth. It sets the stage for the rest of Matthew's account of Jesus' life, ministry, death, and resurrection.

### Chapter 2

Matthew chapter 2 is a significant passage in the New Testament that recounts the events surrounding Jesus' birth and early childhood. Here's an explanation of the key elements in this chapter:

### The Visit of the Wise Men

The chapter begins with the arrival of wise men (often called Magi) from the East in Jerusalem. They were seeking the newborn "King of the Jews," having seen his star. This event likely occurred some time after Jesus' birth, as he is referred to as a "young child" rather than a newborn.

Key points:
- The wise men followed a star, believing it signified the birth of a great king.
- They first went to Jerusalem, the capital, assuming the new king would be born there.
- Their arrival and inquiry troubled King Herod and all of Jerusalem.

### Herod's Reaction and the Prophecy

Herod, feeling threatened by the news of a potential rival, consulted with the chief priests and scribes. They informed him of the prophecy that the Messiah would be born in Bethlehem.

Key points:
- Herod's reaction reveals his fear and insecurity about his position.
- The prophecy cited is from Micah 5:2, emphasizing Bethlehem's significance.

### The Wise Men's Journey to Bethlehem

Herod secretly met with the wise men, asking them to report back to him about the child's location. The wise men continued to Bethlehem, following the star.

Key points:
- Herod's request was deceitful, masking his true intentions.
- The star guided the wise men directly to Jesus' location.

### The Adoration and Gifts

The wise men found Jesus and Mary, worshipped him, and presented gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh. They were then warned in a dream not to return to Herod and left for their country by another route.

Key points:
- The gifts were valuable and symbolic, befitting a king.
- Divine intervention (the dream) protected Jesus from Herod's plans.

### The Flight to Egypt

An angel appeared to Joseph in a dream, warning him to flee to Egypt with Mary and Jesus to escape Herod's intentions. This fulfilled another prophecy about the Messiah coming out of Egypt.

Key points:
- Divine guidance continued to protect Jesus and his family.
- The flight to Egypt fulfilled the prophecy from Hosea 11:1.

### Herod's Massacre of the Innocents

Realizing he had been outwitted by the wise men, Herod ordered the killing of all male children two years old and under in and around Bethlehem. This tragic event fulfilled a prophecy from Jeremiah about Rachel weeping for her children.

Key points:
- Herod's actions demonstrate his ruthlessness and fear of losing power.
- The massacre fulfilled Jeremiah 31:15, connecting Jesus' story to Israel's history.

### Return to Nazareth

After Herod's death, an angel again appeared to Joseph, instructing him to return to Israel. Fearing Herod's son Archelaus, who now ruled Judea, Joseph settled in Nazareth in Galilee.

Key points:
- Divine guidance continued to direct Jesus' family.
- Settling in Nazareth fulfilled prophecies about Jesus being called a Nazarene.

### Summary

Matthew chapter 2 emphasizes several important themes:
1. The fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies in Jesus' life.
2. Divine protection and guidance for Jesus and his family.
3. The contrast between those who sought to worship Jesus (the wise men) and those who sought to destroy him (Herod).
4. The early recognition of Jesus as a king, even by foreign wise men.

This chapter sets the stage for Jesus' ministry by establishing his identity as the prophesied Messiah and highlighting the extraordinary circumstances surrounding his birth and early life.

### Chapter 3

Matthew Chapter 3 is a significant chapter in the New Testament that introduces John the Baptist and describes the baptism of Jesus. Let's break down the key elements of this chapter:

### Introduction of John the Baptist

John the Baptist is introduced as a preacher in the wilderness of Judea. His message is clear and urgent:

- He calls for repentance, saying, "Repent, for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand!"
- This fulfills the prophecy of Isaiah, who spoke of a voice crying in the wilderness to prepare the way for the Lord.

John's appearance and lifestyle are described:

- He wore clothing made of camel's hair with a leather belt.
- His diet consisted of locusts and wild honey.

These details emphasize John's austere and ascetic lifestyle, setting him apart as a prophet.

### John's Baptism and Message

People from Jerusalem, Judea, and the surrounding regions came to John:

- They were baptized by him in the Jordan River.
- They confessed their sins as part of this baptism.

When John saw Pharisees and Sadducees coming for baptism, he rebuked them:

- He called them "offspring of vipers" and challenged their motives.
- John emphasized the need for genuine repentance and good works, not just relying on their ancestry.
- He warned of judgment, using the metaphor of an ax at the root of unfruitful trees.

### John's Prophecy about Jesus

John spoke about someone greater who would come after him:

- He said this person would be mightier than him, so much so that John was not worthy to carry his sandals.
- This person would baptize with the Holy Spirit and fire.
- John used the metaphor of a winnowing fork to describe how this person would separate the righteous from the unrighteous.

### The Baptism of Jesus

Jesus came from Galilee to be baptized by John:

- John initially resisted, feeling unworthy to baptize Jesus.
- Jesus insisted, saying it was necessary to fulfill all righteousness.

After Jesus was baptized, a miraculous event occurred:

- The heavens opened.
- The Spirit of God descended like a dove upon Jesus.
- A voice from heaven declared, "This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased."

This event marks the beginning of Jesus' public ministry and confirms his identity as the Son of God.

### Key Themes

1. Repentance: John's primary message was a call to repentance in preparation for the coming Kingdom of Heaven.
2. Fulfillment of Prophecy: John's appearance and ministry fulfill Old Testament prophecies about a messenger preparing the way for the Messiah.
3. Judgment: John warns of coming judgment for those who do not repent and bear good fruit.
4. The superiority of Jesus: John clearly states that the one coming after him (Jesus) is far greater and more powerful.
5. The Trinity: At Jesus' baptism, we see all three persons of the Trinity present - the Father (the voice from heaven), the Son (Jesus), and the Holy Spirit (descending like a dove).

This chapter sets the stage for Jesus' ministry, establishing his divine identity and the need for repentance and preparation for the Kingdom of Heaven.
