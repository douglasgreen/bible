# New Testament Commentary

## Matthew

### Chapter 1

Matthew chapter 1 is the opening chapter of the Gospel of Matthew in the New Testament. This chapter serves several important purposes and contains key elements of the Christian faith. Let's break down the chapter and explore its significance:

### Genealogy of Jesus

The chapter begins with a detailed genealogy of Jesus Christ, tracing His lineage from Abraham to Joseph, Mary's husband. This genealogy serves several purposes:

1. Establishes Jesus' Jewish heritage: By tracing Jesus' lineage back to Abraham, the father of the Jewish people, Matthew emphasizes Jesus' connection to the Jewish faith and traditions.
2. Highlights Jesus' royal lineage: The genealogy includes King David, emphasizing Jesus' claim to the throne of David and His fulfillment of messianic prophecies.
3. Demonstrates God's faithfulness: The genealogy shows how God kept His promises to Abraham and David over many generations.
4. Includes women and Gentiles: The inclusion of women (Tamar, Rahab, Ruth, and Bathsheba) and Gentiles in the genealogy demonstrates God's inclusive plan of salvation.

### Structure of the Genealogy

Matthew organizes the genealogy into three sets of fourteen generations:

1. From Abraham to David
2. From David to the Babylonian exile
3. From the Babylonian exile to Jesus

This structure may have been used for memorization purposes or to emphasize certain theological points.

### The Birth of Jesus

The chapter then transitions to the story of Jesus' birth, focusing on Joseph's perspective. Key elements include:

1. Mary's miraculous conception: Mary is found to be pregnant through the Holy Spirit before she and Joseph have consummated their marriage.
2. Joseph's dilemma: As a righteous man, Joseph plans to divorce Mary quietly to avoid public shame.
3. Divine intervention: An angel appears to Joseph in a dream, explaining the miraculous nature of Mary's pregnancy and instructing him to take Mary as his wife.
4. Fulfillment of prophecy: Matthew quotes Isaiah 7:14, connecting Jesus' birth to Old Testament prophecies about the Messiah.
5. The naming of Jesus: The angel instructs Joseph to name the child Jesus, explaining that He will save His people from their sins.

### Theological Significance

This chapter establishes several important theological points:

1. Jesus as the Messiah: By tracing Jesus' lineage and connecting His birth to Old Testament prophecies, Matthew presents Jesus as the long-awaited Messiah.
2. Virgin birth: The chapter affirms the doctrine of the virgin birth, emphasizing Jesus' divine nature.
3. God's plan of salvation: The genealogy and birth narrative demonstrate God's long-term plan for human salvation, culminating in Jesus.
4. Jesus' humanity and divinity: The chapter presents Jesus as both fully human (through His genealogy) and fully divine (through His miraculous conception).

In conclusion, Matthew chapter 1 serves as a powerful introduction to the Gospel, establishing Jesus' identity as the Messiah, His connection to Jewish history, and the miraculous nature of His birth. It sets the stage for the rest of Matthew's account of Jesus' life, ministry, death, and resurrection.

### Chapter 2

Matthew chapter 2 is a significant passage in the New Testament that recounts the events surrounding Jesus' birth and early childhood. Here's an explanation of the key elements in this chapter:

### The Visit of the Wise Men

The chapter begins with the arrival of wise men (often called Magi) from the East in Jerusalem. They were seeking the newborn "King of the Jews," having seen his star. This event likely occurred some time after Jesus' birth, as he is referred to as a "young child" rather than a newborn.

Key points:
- The wise men followed a star, believing it signified the birth of a great king.
- They first went to Jerusalem, the capital, assuming the new king would be born there.
- Their arrival and inquiry troubled King Herod and all of Jerusalem.

### Herod's Reaction and the Prophecy

Herod, feeling threatened by the news of a potential rival, consulted with the chief priests and scribes. They informed him of the prophecy that the Messiah would be born in Bethlehem.

Key points:
- Herod's reaction reveals his fear and insecurity about his position.
- The prophecy cited is from Micah 5:2, emphasizing Bethlehem's significance.

### The Wise Men's Journey to Bethlehem

Herod secretly met with the wise men, asking them to report back to him about the child's location. The wise men continued to Bethlehem, following the star.

Key points:
- Herod's request was deceitful, masking his true intentions.
- The star guided the wise men directly to Jesus' location.

### The Adoration and Gifts

The wise men found Jesus and Mary, worshipped him, and presented gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh. They were then warned in a dream not to return to Herod and left for their country by another route.

Key points:
- The gifts were valuable and symbolic, befitting a king.
- Divine intervention (the dream) protected Jesus from Herod's plans.

### The Flight to Egypt

An angel appeared to Joseph in a dream, warning him to flee to Egypt with Mary and Jesus to escape Herod's intentions. This fulfilled another prophecy about the Messiah coming out of Egypt.

Key points:
- Divine guidance continued to protect Jesus and his family.
- The flight to Egypt fulfilled the prophecy from Hosea 11:1.

### Herod's Massacre of the Innocents

Realizing he had been outwitted by the wise men, Herod ordered the killing of all male children two years old and under in and around Bethlehem. This tragic event fulfilled a prophecy from Jeremiah about Rachel weeping for her children.

Key points:
- Herod's actions demonstrate his ruthlessness and fear of losing power.
- The massacre fulfilled Jeremiah 31:15, connecting Jesus' story to Israel's history.

### Return to Nazareth

After Herod's death, an angel again appeared to Joseph, instructing him to return to Israel. Fearing Herod's son Archelaus, who now ruled Judea, Joseph settled in Nazareth in Galilee.

Key points:
- Divine guidance continued to direct Jesus' family.
- Settling in Nazareth fulfilled prophecies about Jesus being called a Nazarene.

### Summary

Matthew chapter 2 emphasizes several important themes:
1. The fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies in Jesus' life.
2. Divine protection and guidance for Jesus and his family.
3. The contrast between those who sought to worship Jesus (the wise men) and those who sought to destroy him (Herod).
4. The early recognition of Jesus as a king, even by foreign wise men.

This chapter sets the stage for Jesus' ministry by establishing his identity as the prophesied Messiah and highlighting the extraordinary circumstances surrounding his birth and early life.

### Chapter 3

Matthew Chapter 3 is a significant chapter in the New Testament that introduces John the Baptist and describes the baptism of Jesus. Let's break down the key elements of this chapter:

### Introduction of John the Baptist

John the Baptist is introduced as a preacher in the wilderness of Judea. His message is clear and urgent:

- He calls for repentance, saying, "Repent, for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand!"
- This fulfills the prophecy of Isaiah, who spoke of a voice crying in the wilderness to prepare the way for the Lord.

John's appearance and lifestyle are described:

- He wore clothing made of camel's hair with a leather belt.
- His diet consisted of locusts and wild honey.

These details emphasize John's austere and ascetic lifestyle, setting him apart as a prophet.

### John's Baptism and Message

People from Jerusalem, Judea, and the surrounding regions came to John:

- They were baptized by him in the Jordan River.
- They confessed their sins as part of this baptism.

When John saw Pharisees and Sadducees coming for baptism, he rebuked them:

- He called them "offspring of vipers" and challenged their motives.
- John emphasized the need for genuine repentance and good works, not just relying on their ancestry.
- He warned of judgment, using the metaphor of an ax at the root of unfruitful trees.

### John's Prophecy about Jesus

John spoke about someone greater who would come after him:

- He said this person would be mightier than him, so much so that John was not worthy to carry his sandals.
- This person would baptize with the Holy Spirit and fire.
- John used the metaphor of a winnowing fork to describe how this person would separate the righteous from the unrighteous.

### The Baptism of Jesus

Jesus came from Galilee to be baptized by John:

- John initially resisted, feeling unworthy to baptize Jesus.
- Jesus insisted, saying it was necessary to fulfill all righteousness.

After Jesus was baptized, a miraculous event occurred:

- The heavens opened.
- The Spirit of God descended like a dove upon Jesus.
- A voice from heaven declared, "This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased."

This event marks the beginning of Jesus' public ministry and confirms his identity as the Son of God.

### Key Themes

1. Repentance: John's primary message was a call to repentance in preparation for the coming Kingdom of Heaven.
2. Fulfillment of Prophecy: John's appearance and ministry fulfill Old Testament prophecies about a messenger preparing the way for the Messiah.
3. Judgment: John warns of coming judgment for those who do not repent and bear good fruit.
4. The superiority of Jesus: John clearly states that the one coming after him (Jesus) is far greater and more powerful.
5. The Trinity: At Jesus' baptism, we see all three persons of the Trinity present - the Father (the voice from heaven), the Son (Jesus), and the Holy Spirit (descending like a dove).

This chapter sets the stage for Jesus' ministry, establishing his divine identity and the need for repentance and preparation for the Kingdom of Heaven.

### Chapter 4

Matthew Chapter 4 is a significant chapter in the New Testament that covers several important events in Jesus' life and ministry. Let's break down the key elements of this chapter:

### The Temptation of Jesus

The chapter begins with Jesus being led by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil. This occurs after Jesus' baptism and before the start of his public ministry.

Key points:
- Jesus fasted for 40 days and nights, echoing Moses' and Elijah's experiences.
- The devil tempts Jesus three times, targeting different aspects of human weakness:
  1. Physical needs (turning stones into bread)
  2. Testing God's protection (jumping from the temple)
  3. Worldly power and glory (offering all kingdoms)

Jesus responds to each temptation by quoting Scripture, demonstrating the power of God's word in resisting temptation.

### The Beginning of Jesus' Ministry

After the temptation, the chapter shifts to the start of Jesus' public ministry:

- Jesus withdraws to Galilee after hearing about John the Baptist's arrest.
- He settles in Capernaum, fulfilling a prophecy from Isaiah about light coming to the Gentiles.
- Jesus begins preaching, calling people to repent and proclaiming the nearness of the Kingdom of Heaven.

### Calling of the First Disciples

Jesus calls his first disciples while walking by the Sea of Galilee:

- He calls two pairs of brothers: Simon (Peter) and Andrew, James and John.
- All four immediately leave their fishing businesses to follow Jesus.
- Jesus promises to make them "fishers of men," indicating their future role in spreading his message.

### Jesus' Ministry in Galilee

The chapter concludes with a summary of Jesus' early ministry:

- He travels throughout Galilee, teaching in synagogues and preaching the Good News.
- Jesus heals various diseases and sicknesses, demonstrating his divine power.
- His fame spreads throughout Syria, attracting large crowds from various regions.

### Key Themes

1. The power of God's word in overcoming temptation
2. The fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies in Jesus' life and ministry
3. The call to repentance and the proclamation of the Kingdom of Heaven
4. The immediate and radical response of the disciples to Jesus' call
5. Jesus' authority over sickness and demons, attracting widespread attention

This chapter sets the stage for Jesus' ministry, highlighting his divine nature, his mission, and the beginning of his impact on the people of his time.

### Chapter 5

Matthew Chapter 5 is a significant part of Jesus' Sermon on the Mount, containing some of the most well-known teachings of Jesus. This chapter can be broken down into several key sections:

### The Beatitudes

The chapter begins with the Beatitudes, a series of blessings pronounced by Jesus:

- "Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven."
- "Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted."
- "Blessed are the gentle, for they shall inherit the earth."
- "Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be filled."
- "Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy."
- "Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God."
- "Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called children of God."
- "Blessed are those who have been persecuted for righteousness' sake, for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven."

These teachings emphasize spiritual virtues and promise divine blessings to those who embody them.

### Salt and Light

Jesus then uses metaphors to describe his followers:

- "You are the salt of the earth" - emphasizing their preserving and flavoring influence on the world.
- "You are the light of the world" - highlighting their role in illuminating and guiding others.

### Fulfillment of the Law

Jesus clarifies his relationship to the Mosaic Law:

- He states that he came not to abolish the law but to fulfill it.
- He emphasizes the importance of following even the smallest commandments.
- He calls for a righteousness that exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees.

### Teachings on Anger, Reconciliation, and Adultery

Jesus reinterprets and deepens traditional teachings:

- He equates anger with murder in terms of moral gravity.
- He stresses the importance of reconciliation before worship.
- He internalizes the concept of adultery, including lustful thoughts.

### Teachings on Divorce, Oaths, and Retaliation

Jesus continues to challenge traditional interpretations:

- He restricts the grounds for divorce.
- He advises against swearing oaths, encouraging simple truthfulness instead.
- He rejects the "eye for an eye" principle, advocating non-retaliation and going beyond what is demanded.

### Love for Enemies

The chapter concludes with Jesus' radical teaching on love:

- He instructs his followers to love their enemies and pray for their persecutors.
- He calls for a love that extends beyond one's immediate circle, mirroring God's impartial love.
- He sets the standard of perfection, calling his followers to emulate the perfection of God.

This chapter represents a significant portion of Jesus' ethical teachings, often challenging conventional wisdom and calling for a higher standard of moral and spiritual conduct. It emphasizes internal motivations and attitudes as much as external actions, setting a foundation for Christian ethics and spirituality.

### Chapter 6

Matthew Chapter 6 is a significant part of Jesus' Sermon on the Mount, focusing on various aspects of spiritual life and practical faith. Here's an explanation of the key themes and teachings in this chapter:

### Charitable Giving

Jesus teaches about the proper attitude and approach to charitable giving:

- He warns against doing charitable deeds for public recognition.
- Emphasizes that true charity should be done in secret, without seeking praise from others.
- Promises that God, who sees in secret, will reward such genuine acts of kindness.

### Prayer

Jesus provides guidance on how to pray:

- Criticizes hypocritical prayer that's done for show.
- Encourages private, sincere prayer.
- Teaches the Lord's Prayer as a model, emphasizing:
  - Reverence for God
  - Seeking God's will
  - Asking for daily needs
  - Forgiveness of sins
  - Protection from temptation

### Forgiveness

- Jesus stresses the importance of forgiving others.
- He links our forgiveness of others to God's forgiveness of us.

### Fasting

- Similar to giving and prayer, Jesus teaches that fasting should be done privately.
- The focus should be on the spiritual aspect, not on appearing pious to others.

### Treasures in Heaven

- Jesus advises against accumulating earthly wealth, which is temporary and vulnerable.
- Instead, He encourages storing up "treasures in heaven" - spiritual riches that last eternally.

### The Eye as the Lamp of the Body

- Jesus uses a metaphor of the eye as the body's lamp.
- A "sound" or healthy eye fills the body with light, while an "evil" eye leads to darkness.
- This likely refers to one's spiritual perspective and its impact on one's life.

### Serving God vs. Wealth

- Jesus teaches that one cannot serve both God and wealth (Mammon).
- He emphasizes the need to prioritize spiritual matters over material concerns.

### Anxiety and Trust in God

- Jesus addresses worry and anxiety, particularly about material needs.
- He uses examples from nature (birds, lilies) to illustrate God's care for His creation.
- Encourages trust in God's provision and seeking His kingdom first.

### Living in the Present

- Jesus concludes by advising against worrying about the future.
- He encourages focusing on today's challenges, trusting God for tomorrow.

In essence, Matthew Chapter 6 emphasizes sincere, private spiritual practices, trust in God's provision, and prioritizing spiritual wealth over material concerns. It encourages a life focused on God's kingdom rather than earthly worries and appearances.

### Chapter 7

Matthew Chapter 7 is a significant part of Jesus' Sermon on the Mount, containing various teachings and parables. Let's break down the key points and themes of this chapter:

### Judging Others

Jesus begins by warning against judging others harshly:

- He advises not to judge others, lest we be judged by the same standard.
- He uses the metaphor of a speck in someone else's eye versus a beam in one's own eye to illustrate hypocrisy.
- The teaching emphasizes self-reflection and addressing one's own faults before criticizing others.

### Discernment in Sharing Spiritual Truths

Jesus then speaks about discernment:

- He advises not to give what is holy to dogs or throw pearls before swine.
- This metaphor suggests being wise about sharing spiritual truths with those who might reject or misuse them.

### Prayer and God's Generosity

The chapter continues with teachings on prayer:

- Jesus encourages his followers to ask, seek, and knock, assuring them that God responds to sincere prayers.
- He compares God's generosity to that of earthly fathers, emphasizing God's superior goodness.
- The Golden Rule is introduced: treat others as you would want to be treated.

### The Narrow Gate

Jesus uses the metaphor of a narrow gate:

- He describes the path to life as narrow and difficult to find, while the path to destruction is broad and easy.
- This teaching emphasizes the challenges of following Jesus' teachings but also their ultimate reward.

### False Prophets and True Disciples

The chapter then focuses on discerning true from false teachings:

- Jesus warns about false prophets who appear harmless but are actually dangerous.
- He teaches that true disciples can be recognized by their "fruits" or actions, not just their words.
- He emphasizes that not everyone who claims to follow him will enter the Kingdom of Heaven, but only those who do God's will.

### Building on a Solid Foundation

The chapter concludes with the parable of the wise and foolish builders:

- Those who hear Jesus' words and put them into practice are like a wise man who builds his house on rock.
- Those who hear but don't act are like a foolish man who builds on sand.
- This parable emphasizes the importance of not just hearing Jesus' teachings, but living them out.

### Conclusion

The chapter ends by noting the crowd's astonishment at Jesus' teaching, recognizing his authority as different from their usual religious leaders.

Matthew Chapter 7 emphasizes practical application of faith, discernment, and the importance of aligning one's actions with belief. It challenges listeners to examine their own lives and motivations, rather than judging others, and to build their lives on the solid foundation of Jesus' teachings.

## Romans

### Chapter 1

Romans Chapter 1 is a foundational text in the New Testament, written by the Apostle Paul to the church in Rome. This chapter sets the stage for Paul's theological exposition of the gospel and addresses several key themes. Let's break down the chapter into its main sections:

### Introduction and Greeting (verses 1-7)

Paul begins by introducing himself as a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle. He emphasizes that:

- The gospel was promised beforehand in the Scriptures
- Jesus is both human (descended from David) and divine (declared to be the Son of God)
- Paul's mission is to bring about the obedience of faith among all nations

He then greets the believers in Rome, addressing them as beloved of God and called to be saints.

### Paul's Desire to Visit Rome (verses 8-15)

In this section, Paul expresses his:

- Gratitude for the faith of the Roman believers
- Constant prayers for them
- Desire to visit them to impart some spiritual gift and be mutually encouraged
- Eagerness to preach the gospel in Rome

### The Theme of the Letter: The Righteousness of God (verses 16-17)

Paul introduces the central theme of his letter:

- The gospel is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes
- In the gospel, God's righteousness is revealed through faith
- "The righteous shall live by faith" (a quote from Habakkuk 2:4)

### God's Wrath Against Sinful Humanity (verses 18-32)

The final section of the chapter describes God's righteous anger against human sinfulness:

- God's wrath is revealed against all ungodliness and unrighteousness
- Humans are without excuse because God's eternal power and divine nature are evident in creation
- Despite knowing God, people did not honor Him or give thanks
- Humanity exchanged the truth of God for a lie, worshiping created things rather than the Creator

Paul then describes the consequences of this rejection of God:

- God gave them over to their sinful desires
- This resulted in various forms of sexual immorality and a list of other vices
- Those who practice such things are worthy of death, yet they not only do them but approve of others who practice them

### Key Points to Consider

1. Paul establishes his authority as an apostle and sets the stage for his theological exposition.

2. The gospel is central to Paul's message, emphasizing both its Jewish roots and its universal application.

3. The concept of righteousness through faith is introduced, which will be developed further in the epistle.

4. Paul presents a stark contrast between the righteousness of God and the sinfulness of humanity.

5. The chapter provides a foundation for understanding human sin and the need for salvation, which Paul will address in subsequent chapters.

### Best Practices for Interpretation

1. Consider the historical and cultural context of Rome in the first century.

2. Recognize that this chapter is part of a larger argument that Paul develops throughout the epistle.

3. Understand that Paul's description of human sinfulness is meant to establish the universal need for the gospel, not to single out specific groups.

4. Read this chapter in light of the overall message of grace and salvation that Paul presents in Romans.

5. Be aware of the rhetorical techniques Paul uses, such as the repetition of "God gave them over" to emphasize the consequences of rejecting God.

Romans Chapter 1 sets the stage for Paul's comprehensive explanation of the gospel, establishing the need for salvation and introducing key themes that he will develop throughout the letter.

### Chapter 2

Romans Chapter 2 is a significant part of the Apostle Paul's letter to the Romans, addressing several key themes related to judgment, righteousness, and the relationship between Jews and Gentiles. Here's an explanation of the main points in this chapter:

### God's Righteous Judgment

The chapter begins by addressing those who judge others while practicing the same sins themselves. Paul emphasizes that God's judgment is impartial and based on truth:

- No one can escape God's judgment by judging others
- God's judgment is based on one's actions, not just knowledge of the law
- God's kindness is meant to lead people to repentance

### Impartiality of God's Judgment

Paul stresses that God judges all people equally, regardless of their background:

- Both Jews and Gentiles will be judged by their deeds
- God shows no favoritism between Jews and Gentiles
- Those who persist in doing good will receive eternal life, while those who reject the truth will face wrath

### The Law and Conscience

Paul discusses the relationship between the law, conscience, and judgment:

- Gentiles who don't have the law but naturally do what it requires show that the law is written on their hearts
- Conscience serves as an internal witness, either accusing or defending one's actions
- God will judge people's secrets through Jesus Christ

### Hypocrisy of Some Jews

Paul addresses the hypocrisy of some Jews who rely on their heritage and knowledge of the law:

- Having the law and teaching others doesn't exempt one from judgment
- Boasting about the law while breaking it dishonors God
- True circumcision is of the heart, not just physical

### True Judaism

The chapter concludes by redefining what it means to be a true Jew:

- Being a Jew is not just about outward appearances or physical circumcision
- True Judaism is a matter of the heart, guided by the Spirit
- Genuine praise comes from God, not from human recognition

In essence, Romans 2 emphasizes the universal nature of sin and the need for genuine righteousness that goes beyond mere religious observance or cultural identity. It challenges both Jews and Gentiles to recognize their accountability before God and the importance of living out their faith in action.

### Chapter 3

Romans Chapter 3 is a complex and theologically rich passage that addresses several important themes in Christian theology. Here's an explanation of its key points:

### The Advantage of the Jews

The chapter begins by addressing the question of whether there is any advantage to being Jewish. Paul affirms that there is indeed an advantage, primarily because the Jews were entrusted with God's revelations (the Old Testament scriptures).

### God's Faithfulness and Human Unrighteousness

Paul emphasizes that God remains faithful even when humans are unfaithful. He argues that human unrighteousness actually serves to highlight God's righteousness. However, he quickly dismisses the idea that this might justify doing evil so that good may come from it.

### Universal Sinfulness

A central theme of this chapter is the universal nature of sin. Paul quotes extensively from the Old Testament to demonstrate that both Jews and Gentiles are under sin's power. He emphasizes that:

- No one is righteous
- No one seeks God
- All have turned away from God
- No one does good

### The Purpose of the Law

Paul explains that the law's purpose is not to make people righteous, but to bring awareness of sin. He states that "through the law comes knowledge of sin."

### Justification by Faith

The heart of the chapter introduces the concept of justification by faith:

- A righteousness from God has been revealed apart from the law
- This righteousness comes through faith in Jesus Christ
- It is available to all who believe, without distinction
- All have sinned and fall short of God's glory
- Justification is a free gift of God's grace through the redemption that came by Christ Jesus

### God's Justice and Mercy

Paul explains how God demonstrated His justice and mercy through Christ:

- God presented Christ as a sacrifice of atonement
- This sacrifice demonstrates God's righteousness
- It allows God to be just and the one who justifies those who have faith in Jesus

### Faith and the Law

The chapter concludes by emphasizing that justification comes by faith, not by observing the law. This applies to both Jews and Gentiles. Paul asserts that this doesn't nullify the law but actually establishes it.

### Key Theological Concepts

1. Universal sinfulness
2. Justification by faith
3. God's righteousness and justice
4. The role of the law
5. Equality of Jews and Gentiles before God

This chapter is foundational to Protestant theology, particularly the doctrine of justification by faith alone. It presents a complex argument about the relationship between God's righteousness, human sinfulness, the Jewish law, and faith in Christ.
